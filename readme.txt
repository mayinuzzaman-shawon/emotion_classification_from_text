
Dataset Description:
GitterCom_Original.csv -> The original dataset of GitterCom with 10000 instances
gittercom_cohen_kappa.csv -> The first 400 instances manually annotated to compute Cohen-Kappa's Inter-Agreement Score
gittercom_annotated_data.csv -> The 1000 instances from GitterCom dataset (200 instances from each first five channels) that was manually annotated 


Code Description:
gittercom_cohen_kappa.ipynb -> code that was used to compute Cohen Kappa Score

gittercom_emotion_classification_naive_bayes.ipynb -> code for emotion classification using Naive Bayes
gittercom_emotion_classification_decision_trees.ipynb -> code for emotion classification using Decision Trees
gittercom_emotion_classification_svm.ipynb -> code for emotion classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
gittercom_emotion_classification_textCNN.ipynb -> code for emotion classification using textCNN
gittercom_emotion_classification_BiLSTM.ipynb -> code for emotion classification using BiLSTM

To run all the code, please change the dataset loading path and use the apprpriate dataset which was discussed in detail above. Since all the code are in Jupyter Notebook, it is recommended to run it either on Colab or Anaconda.
