Cucumber,"Hi Team, I just recently upgraded our cucumber-jvm version ever since then I am getting following error ",fear,fear
Cucumber,So github is trying to replace irc :P,fear,fear
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy Thanks , seems like I was using older version of cucumber-core , updated the maven with specific version and things started working ",joy,joy
Cucumber,@Sidkiyassine just call the methods directly!,surprise,angry
Cucumber,"Hello guys, need a help.I want to call the run my featute file by calling the cucumber.cli.Main form a java class by passing the the parameters like tags ,format..I its possible.I don want to use cucumber options as I have to pass the tag name s as a variable ...",fear,fear
Cucumber,"Hello guys,\nIs it possible to get  test coverage using jacoco for android tests?\ndefaultConfig {\n              testInstrumentationRunner \cucumber.api.android.CucumberInstrumentation\\n    }",fear,fear
Cucumber,"hey everyone, can someone help me out with running a feature file with specific tags included and excluded?",fear,surprise
Cucumber,and the above doesnt seem to work :(,fear,fear
Cucumber,or does it create a new object every time also?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"I think, but it's been a while since I did ruby cucumbers, that objects created in ruby stepdefs files not inside of a Before aren't re-initialized every time",fear,sadness
Cucumber,is that assumption correct?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"hey everyone, is it possible to run only a subset of examples in a table for scenario outline?",fear,surprise
Cucumber,is it possible to tag specific table entries instead?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"ah, interesting. Ill play around with this :)",joy,joy
Cucumber,"1) it doesn\u2019t seem to call the constructor, or even instanciate final fields, which is a bit of a pain",anger,anger
Cucumber,2) there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to use transforms in conjunction with it (I don\u2019t really understand how transforms work on Cucumber JVM but that\u2019s what people told me) which would help give you more flexibility,fear,fear
Cucumber,"Seems a bit weak to me. It\u2019s a shame we haven\u2019t had any PRs about this, but I guess a lot of our enterprisey users just don\u2019t consider doing that (or aren\u2019t allowed to while at work)",anger,sadness
Cucumber,"But, I do not know how to make coexist the two versions, one for 3 and another for 4 in the same trunk, without duplicate code.",sadness ,sadness
Cucumber,Again - would need a ticket in order to prioritise this. If there is no ticket the problem doesn't exist.,anger,anger
Cucumber,"its something ive been planning to do as well, let me know if you make any progress :)",love,sadness
Cucumber,"@nablik if you re-run tests and they pass, I assume you've changed something to make them pass. Wouldn't that invalidate the previous test results?",fear,fear
Cucumber,@Simon-Kaz your tests are trying to tell you something. They are trying to tell you your design is too tightly coupled to this external service.,anger,surprise
Cucumber,What's the value of a test result if the tests fail intermittently and have to be run several times in order to pass?,anger,anger
Cucumber,@Simon-Kaz have you considered adopting a ports and adapters design so you can test without depending on external services you don't control?,anger,anger
Cucumber,@nablik so what exactly are you testing? That you can retrieve the data from the 3rd party service? That you\u2019re displaying it properly? Testing both of those in the same test is very inefficient. I\u2019d split that up in independent tests.,anger,anger
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy : My question here is not how to test or not. I have tests that cover each module separately. This one is more end to end test, in integration level. However, my question is related to merging 2 cucumber report into one instead of overwriting it. ",fear,fear
Cucumber,i found a discussion on this topic but i cant find any resolution to it https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cukes/alias$20jbehave/cukes/enPlH3xut2E/Z-KyVl18ytwJ,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy  yes, removing cucumber-java from the classpath fixes that issue. Thanks. ",joy,joy
Cucumber,"Hi, I am trying to run my test, but I can only see that my first test is running, but my second step in the steps definitions is not being executed, plz help, thanks",fear,fear
Cucumber,Has anyone had any joy using cucumber-jvm to  allow bdd of a  Netbeans Platform App? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?,fear,fear
Cucumber,i have a query.. i have multiple feature files but all definations dump into single step defination file.,fear,sadness
Cucumber,now problem is that i want to make multiple step defination files.. but here i did not find any way to share variable between two step defs... ,fear,fear
Cucumber,the work around would be i need to pass variables to each function call which i guess really bad approach,fear,fear
Cucumber,is there any possiblity to simplefy this using DI??,fear,fear
Cucumber,its a crappy situation really,anger,anger
Cucumber,i have an external service that SOMETIMES is down (too often for my taste),sadness,sadness
Cucumber,i can only verify that during a test,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"i need some interim solution for now though, was hoping for the 'skip test' option :)",sadness,fear
Cucumber,"yeah, ive added tags and removed those tests from main suite. I really need them ran though :(",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"the failures are intermittent, so it'd be a shame to have the tests removed just because the service is flaky",anger,anger
Cucumber,let it fail so the business prioritizes fixing it? :),anger,fear
Cucumber,lol its out of my reach sadnessly,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,@dkowis I like that advice!,love,love
Cucumber,"So when people come by and are like, Why are your tests failing? Because I need to insulate myself from crappy services",anger,anger
Cucumber,and they don't care about failing tests?,surprise,surprise
Cucumber,all marked with 1 failure :D,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"fortunately, given that its only one test, it should be relatively easy to fix?",joy,joy
Cucumber,so i dont think i can mock that one and leave the rest,fear,fear
Cucumber,Your tests are trying to tell you something. ,anger,anger
Cucumber,They\u2019re whispering \u201cyour app is hard to test. make it easy to test\,anger,anger
Cucumber,nailed it!,joy,joy
Cucumber,"Solve the fundamental problem, stop looking for workarounds ;-)",joy,joy
Cucumber,i need the server dev to work out the setup/architecture for mock server though,fear,fear
Cucumber,no point working with flaky services,anger,anger
Cucumber,"after all, they are not what im testing",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,how can I achieve this -- a little details would help ,fear,fear
Cucumber,i checked prototype and singleton but they did not work,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,so how can we do that.. let me upload my sample code.,fear,fear
Cucumber,is there a way to detect if a feature is finished?,fear,fear
Cucumber,Why do you need to detect if a feature is \finished\?,anger,anger
Cucumber,or why not use @AfterClass,anger,anger
Cucumber,theres no @AfterClass in cucumber jvm,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"Ah, because it hasn't been finished yet",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"yep, sadnessly",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,i think i tried all the possible options already ;),sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"welp, pull requests accepted, heh",joy,surprise
Cucumber,zsolt fabok's suggestion is really good if you need to do something at the end of suite,joy,joy
Cucumber,"but my suite takes 3 hours, so i need to do something at the end of feature instead :)",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,Might have to do the much uglier \And the server is stopped\ steps for now,anger,anger
Cucumber,"less than ideal, and it bleeds things that shouldn't be in the feature, but it's where we're at right now",anger,surprise
Cucumber,"ill play around with it some more, i need to work out something anyway :)",joy,joy
Cucumber,good luck,love,love
Cucumber,ill definitely try :),joy,joy
Cucumber,Has anyone successfully run cucumber-jvm using testng running each user case in a separate thread?,fear,fear
Cucumber,cucumber-jvm is not thread-safe,fear,fear
Cucumber,dont think that'll work,fear,fear
Cucumber,so for now if I want to use gherkin in java either I run my tests serialized or look for another option other than cucumber-jvm?,fear,fear
Cucumber,some tests are inherently slow,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,and splitting the suite in different groups doesn't look like a good option,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,e2e tests can indicate a lack of trust in lower level tests,fear,fear
Cucumber,or a lack of coverage in those lower level tests,fear,fear
Cucumber,"There are no lower level tests I'm afraid, legacy code, hard to add unit testing there, also monolythical app so no API tests",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"yeah, that's hard",sadness,fear
Cucumber,just slow,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,sometimes you're not in position to add lower level tests ,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,my job as an automation engineer is to create e2e/ui tests,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,Yeah that's a sign of sickness in the organization,anger,anger
Cucumber,They're going to have a bad time,fear,fear
Cucumber,that's a silo,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"sorry, man :(",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"Advocate for the change, not that it may get you anywhere",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,I'm currently in a similar area right now,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,and it's unbelievably frustrating,anger,anger
Cucumber,"Hi guys, is there a cucumber-jvm branch accepting the Pickle type Steps from ast?",fear,fear
Cucumber,hi @demos74dx. As far as I know there isn't yet. Are you interested in helping out with it?,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,I think it needs a pretty big refactor to accomplish though,fear,fear
Cucumber,you could do worse than use http://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby-core for reference,anger,anger
Cucumber,took us about 18 months!,surprise,surprise
Cucumber,I'll take a look thanks,love,love
Cucumber,"So, I've been wondering though, or maybe I'm \cuking it wrong\",fear,fear
Cucumber,@mattwynne Am I correct in assuming that everything in  core.cucumber.runtime.model is trash and replaced by ast?,fear,fear
Cucumber,also what does ast stand for?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"Hello,\nCan we run Scenarios or feature in parallel with only one runner class ?  ",fear,surprise
Cucumber,I'm having problems printing reports on Cucumber JVM ,fear,fear
Cucumber,I'm trying to use  https://github.com/damianszczepanik/cucumber-reporting  the reports are generated but no data is printed on them it shows 0 results,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,did this happen to anyone?,fear,fear
Cucumber,i get it whenever the build fails,fear,fear
Cucumber,"the reports are generated and I have tests that had failed and pass but I get non of this in the reports, the json file is generated and it has the pertinent data, the reports are just not showing it",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"and i had to specify the path to the file, otherwise the reports would return blank because i had other json files in there",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"I'm using maven by the way, and it is using that file because if I rename it brakes",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,yes I am!,surprise,surprise
Cucumber,"from what I can see is not injecting the data into the html, but that's strange because I can't even generate the report without the  JSON file with the data that it needs to populate the actual report, I'm so confused ",fear,fear
Cucumber,"It\u2019s a fairly big task to refactor Cucumber-JVM to use Gherkin3 - @brasmusson did it for Cucumber-Ruby. I have a branch on Cucumber-JVM that started the work, but there is still lots to do",fear,fear
Cucumber,im interested ,joy,joy
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz I'll get one to you tomorrow, nothing is checked in atm and the code is a cluster fuck (pardon my french)",anger,anger
Cucumber,I'm also referring to the ruby implementation wherever possible to mirror some of that.  Not so great at ruby so it's more of a guideline than anything for me.,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz I'm also fairly new to Git and contributing to OpenSource, been doing my own thing on Subversion for far far too long.",fear,fear
Cucumber,"So I'm still working out the kinks there, like I \think\ I made my own branch on my fork, but it's not showing up on git for w/e reason.  I'll google all that stuff and get it up after I can clear my mental cache from this bit of refactoring I'm working on.",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,im an automation specialist (whatever that means haha) for appium and selenium,joy,joy
Cucumber,appium is pretty much selenium so its refreshing ;),joy,joy
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz but I want cucumber-jvm to be a plugin when it launches, so I kinda need this working first.",fear,fear
Cucumber,"nice, I've done something similar with spring, but only really done android via selendroid so far.",joy,joy
Cucumber,appium's great,joy,joy
Cucumber,lots of potential,joy,joy
Cucumber,works well with cucumber-jvm too :),joy,joy
Cucumber,appium is an amazing tool for that,joy,joy
Cucumber,oh that's nice,joy,joy
Cucumber,but it didn't capture the time argument,fear,fear
Cucumber,im still kicking myself for not going,sadness,surprise
Cucumber,should've shelled the cash out of my savings,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"I was a bit off because I couldn't see what I was doing on my own screen, only the projector...flying blind",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,I'll  give it a try thank you so much! ,love,love
Cucumber,"@demos74dx thank you for the offer, but I would probably prefer to continue work on my own branch",love,joy
Cucumber,@demos74dx What would users be able to do if Cucumber was a `@Rule` and not a `@RunWith`?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"So their could maintain their own @RunWith configurations, and then simply add the @Rule to the Test Class meant to be run, this is where things get a little weird and (maybe) impossible for cucumber-jvm to do it",fear,fear
Cucumber,"but as you can see, these rules require statement and description to be already implemented at some point",fear,fear
Cucumber,not sure if there's a way to do so within the rule format,fear,fear
Cucumber,"So basically, if Cucumber used rules, it would interfer less with other junit extensions?",fear,fear
Cucumber,or coexist more easily?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"granted you could still provide ways for people to integrate with spring easier, but now things much more decoupled and therefor easier to maintain",joy,joy
Cucumber,"However, there is a whole hierarchy of features/scenarios/steps to run, and it doesn\u2019t look like a `Statement` can have children...",fear,fear
Cucumber,you almost have to forget everything you know about modifying the runner and try to work with the (imaginary) runner already in place.,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,Which again means that IDEs wouldn\u2019t be able to report results nicely,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"yeah, I'm not 100% sure it's cracked up to work with cucumber-jvm, because it's such a strange usecase for JUnit",fear,fear
Cucumber,That would be excellent. Thanks!,love,love
Cucumber,or I solve that...who knows :worried: ,fear,fear
Cucumber,"I almost might have to do that first actually, I am getting paid by somebody to produce results, so I kinda need to get a solution out the door(even if temporary) sometime in the next few days.",fear,fear
Cucumber,"I'll get back to work, so close to running pickles :)",joy,joy
Cucumber,does anybody know which version my IDE should be at for working on this?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"Is anybody familiar with the direction the Keyword annotations are going in?  @Given, @When, @Then, etc?",fear,fear
Cucumber,Does someone know how to integrate spoon and cucumber ?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"Hi ways, any of you know how to use cucumber in a playframework project (scala)",fear,fear
Cucumber,"Solved, thanks anyway",love,love
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy hey, I got sidelined from cucumber for a few days, back on it now.  I noticed these step def annotations were removed in master and I was wondering how they would get implemented, in the mean-time for my code I just made a @StepDef annotation that replaces all of them.  ",fear,fear
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy  I'm not seeing any advantage to TreeMap over HashMap in RuntimeGlue.  TreeMap would be useful if ordering was necessary but I don't see any need for ordering here.  TreeMap access is O(log n) and HashMap access is O(1), we could see about a 10x increase in speed while accessing StepDefinitions if we switched.",anger,joy
Cucumber,Yeah maybe. Sounds like bikeshedding to me ;-),anger,anger
Cucumber,Is there any way to make intellij show colored output? like not monochrome?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy thanks.  I'm wondering if anyone has solved the problem of testing Angular apps from Java. \nBTW, love the Cucumber books",joy,joy
Cucumber,Thanks!,love,joy
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy some team members are suggesting using Cucumber-JS.  I think that would mean either having multiple test suites, or losing a fair amount of investment in Java",fear,fear
Cucumber,"I don't expect all tests to be from the front end, but I would expect to be able to do this.  We can do this from DOM, but AngularJS doesn't really work that way.",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"And while you can test at unit and component level, there's always a chance that they don't work together as expected",fear,sadness
Cucumber,It's perhaps more of a webdriver issue - just wondered if anyone else has had and solved a similar problem,fear,fear
Cucumber,"@otoniel-isidoro-sofist - Thanks, yes I saw that.  It is in JavaScript rather than Java, but it might end up being what we need to use.  Trying to avoid either having multiple test suites, or losing a fair amount of investment in Java",fear,fear
Cucumber,"Yes.  Thanks for your time today @aslakhellesoy.\nIf it's of any interest, the content here looks like it should be of help in my case https://dzone.com/articles/webdriver-and-angularjs",love,love
Cucumber,not glue but clue :),joy,joy
Cucumber,@yevgenys sorry you\u2019d have to read the source code I\u2019m afraid,fear,fear
Cucumber,"i see, ok thx ",love,love
Cucumber,Hi All I need help on this.,fear,fear
Cucumber,"Hi All, I need help on how to organise my step definition in cucumber jvm framework.",fear,fear
Cucumber,"I just gave the opportunity to cucumber-jvm again, but for me is really really important that the tests can execute in parallel. Most of the tests are e2e, wether they're loading a webdriver instance or attacking an API. Switching to jbehave, after researching a bit I think I'll find greener fields there.",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,Can any body help me how to create an executable jar out of cucumber-maven project,fear,fear
Cucumber,i tried with 'maven-shade-plugin' but the created jar does not contain files under 'test' folder. ,sadness,sadness
Cucumber,Hi folks.  Does anyone know where I should put @Before(\@Firefox\) tags?  I can't find very much cohesive information on it.  Intention is to be able to control which webdriver to use for any given test run.\nIt's very possible that this would be better achieved using configuration or Dependency Injection.  Guidance much appreciated :),fear,fear
Cucumber,"For example, The Cucumber Book for Java - which is great btw ;) suggests using\n@Before(\@admin\)\npublic void logInAsadnessmin() { ... }\nI'm not sure where should/could the code go, and when is it executed?",fear,fear
Cucumber,not sure if you've gotten to the dep injection part,fear,fear
Cucumber,"Thanks @Simon-Kaz.  Yes, it could be that I didn't realise that Dependency Injection was required.  I'll re-read",sadness,sadness
Cucumber,"hi, i am running into cucumber-spring-1.2.4 vs spring-boot-1.3.0 issues.  http://pastebin.com/KxVyNsRK (java.lang.ArrayStoreException: sun.reflect.annotation.TypeNotPresentExceptionProxy)",fear,fear
Cucumber,i take it cucumber-jvm needs to catch up with the recent spring boot release? or am i running into a more obscure issue here?,fear,fear
Cucumber,"hey guys,\nI am new in cucumber, but I need to use this(cucumber-jvm + appium) in my project. I installed all this stuff and don't know what to do. I general I understand , but in my project some programmer write some code and there a lot of classes. I confused. Can somebody explain this, or at least send me some helpful articles, I read a lot, but still stuck on this\nThank you very much!",fear,fear

Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I've noticed that it got quite popular, some nice projects are making really good use of it and I'm starting to like it as well.",joy,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,Not sure why I or anyone else got added. Might want to consider asking first. ,anger,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@seiyria Way to kill the vibe, you're free to leave if you want. I'm new to gitter and it suggested me people, probably that starred the project on github and might be interested in it. When I clicked add on someone it said that he was invited, so that sounds like something that has to be approved manually to me. Sorry for your inconvenience, thanks for your feedback.",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,FF is working online so it's definitely a problem with my browser when running localhost,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"oh gitter, why black text on black background for the text input T.T noob mistake, not setting background-color",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's because my system colors are a bit different, but nothing a minor hack didn't fix here :) i'm gonna report a bug though",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,cool; I've recently got into a tendency to use dark themes wherever possible,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i think so too, alright bug reported",sadness,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,can you guide me through how to upgrade an abolished?,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,@tukkek do you mean an ability? Abolished is a unit xD,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"in the issue you say only abolished have upgrades enabled, i just can't find where in the ui i can apply upgrades",fear,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,#869 should be fixed asap perhaps in order to make testing easier ,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i see, great, let me take a look at the source code for the unit though (love how it shouts it's name when summoned btw :D)",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"hehe, that should help with getting people learning the unit names",joy,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"well, it dies and leaves a consumable behind",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"not it's gone, not sure why it didn't leave at first",surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"no, chrome now.. it died but it is still there, both occupying the spaces and in the turn sequence",sadness,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,also how are you supposed to defeat a player if the plasma shield prevents any damage from being done? i'm taking some time to check out the creatures and powers now,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there's a bug currently and the plasma indicator doesn't gets revealed anymore under the dark priest after using some plasma, which makes things a bit more confusing",sadness,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"a lot of small bugs like that which need to be crushed in order to get things back on track, sigh",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i get what plasma is but i don't see it decreasing when i hit the enemy player.. is that the bug you mentioned?,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"so it's not really ideal for your Dark Priest to take hits, even if he gets shielded, as you lose summoning (materialization) potential and get closer to becoming vulnerable",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,that's not extremely important to be shown there,anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"alright i gave the game a better look and i think it's got a ton of potential, and the code seems pretty decent as well - I would expect it to be a lot more disorganized to be honest, considering the hexagon shapes and all. it probably needs a lot of love to reach it's potential though, from bug squashing to computer ai, multiplayer and so on... i still have a lot to learn though so maybe i'm judging things too fast",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but i think im ready to try and code some of those upgrades now :),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good ^^,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"some of the Abolished's ability coding could get clean-up for sure, lots of nested if statements that aren't even required anymore, legacy logic",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,and that's usually the first file people tend to check out and get intimidated,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I'm constantly improving things, so if I keep at it, things should scale nicely for sure",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i saw a bit of that, but mostly a code organization issue, not a design problem.. anyway just my first impression of the code base... looks pretty decent to me even with that",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the guy who coded it is quite amazing, he's a really great artist and wants to pursue that path, so he'll be able to rejoin a bit later on when the focus is primarily on eye candy and animation",love,love

Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"> Shift-enter, as if typing a new paragraph\nbacon, works!",anger,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,> This is a fake quote.,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,fail,sadness,fear

Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"true, it's how markdown works, forgot",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,haha,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,seems you're better at this compared to me,love,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,too much shitposting on forums; learned how to get used to weird formatting,anger,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum woot! so i need to start with @ to mention someone, like on twitter / fb",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"This smileys/emoticons roster is pretty weird, why does anyone need a \large blue circle\ in a conversation is beyond me",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"ahahahaha ikr, maybe it's useful for doing bullet lists or indicating status of something",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yea i guess if network play is ready the ai is not that important anyway! do you guys have any idea how to print a variable value for debugging pruporses? window.alert doesn't seem to work,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,more importantly when I run  `grunt` does it launch the version under the folder \development\?,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,@tukkek yes! grunt is all about the development atm,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"will try to make that more clear, I see how \stable\ vs development can be confusing, setting more stuff into place with time related to that",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,that would be awesome! i guess the design is already pretty good for a gamepad huh.. i wanted to add gamepad support for javelin but there is so many commands it's not really possible,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum yeah, constantly thinking of that, but current engine doesn't do 3d, which will be required xD so I'm guessing there will be a port eventually",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there is so much that can be done with this game, im getting pretty hyped here.. somebody hold me please xD",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,voice recognition: please let me summon creatures by shouting their names like a bad-ass xD,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"haha, a lot of people love mobas because they like clicking a lot, but those type of games don't scale uber well with a lot of tech tbh",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, hard to imagine a moba played with oculus for example.. unless you're just using it as an alternate screen that is attached to your face",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there was a moba made for tablets... and supposedly optimized and bs... but the guys in the trailer were tapping the tablet screens like fucking morons, you would imagine the cracking in no time",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I rage so much while playing on the PC, would probably just smash the tablet to pieces after a few dozen games tops",anger,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,It is not healthy for your phone,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"maybe if someone made a 1st person view for mobas that would really put you in on the action but idk any that is like that... actually i saw one fps moba once but it wasnt that good, not even when compared to the classics",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"played on a neighbour chick's phone a 3vs3 one and I was tapping all around yet still winning, it was pretty easy stuff overall",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Smite is the closest to that, but honestly I can't see that working",sadness,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"It kills your capacity to view your surroundings, you can literally only see what is in front of you",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,the fact the distributor for smite in here is shitty and does all they can to leech money effortlessly does not help >.>,anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"sanity check: units can never have negative hp, right? once they reach 0 they're gone?",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,most of the time you see your character's back mostly.... which is distracting,anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I was constantly pissing off the initial developer  because of stuff like that, but otherwise things would be too alike",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"...I am playing a strategy game (EU4) right now, and the protestant reformation just started in Transylvania somehow. >.>",surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek yeah but I'm a crappy programmer, can't manage to code AB gameplay properly for now, or things would have been way further ahead",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I wanted to convert Sweden to protestant, but the goddamn protestantism spawned on the other end of Europe. #ThanksGame",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum haven't really played any of the civilization games myself :/ so many good old school games mentioned today that I haven't touched, only researched",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,(btw the abolished's drawing is so fabulours i can't handle it haha just look at it all flaming and stuff!),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek if it's not blocked; don't recall if it's coded, but we had some corrections to the formula to avoid ending up with NaN and have playtest ruined thanks to badly coded effects and scenarios",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,> (btw the abolished's drawing is so fabulours i can't handle it haha just look at it all flaming and stuff!)\n\n^ perfect depiction of me when I first saw the drawings,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"good, cause he's a Pride creature after all, @tukkek - might even be might favorite unit xD",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"hahaha i'm loving it. @DreadKnight  ok, this can be changed later as well, i was just wondering if i did my math wrong",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"And then it plays out with historical stuff and so on; empires powerful at the time like France and the turks tend to grow quickly while nations who fell like the byzantine empire dies early on; however, this game always finds a way to screw up history and have something stupid happen xD",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Like appearently having Martin Luther be born in romania, but hey... It's still fun :p ",joy,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,aww hungary converted transylvania back into catholic xd,surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the most obnoxious possible spawns for protestantism ever in this game - transylvania, hungary, sweden and normandy, but nothing in germany...",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,funny seeing different spellings of the same thing,surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"good, I'm confident you'll manage; he's most used after all, so it's important xD",love,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it's almost done :),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,@DreadKnight you're in the wrong neighborhood https://i.gyazo.com/75a78c223ed7aecdacc64f5bfaed976a.png,sadness,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Oh, nice; the chat inlines image links",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,And doesn't crop it!,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Yeah, nice upgrade compared to most IRC clients",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek should have picked a harder one, haha; some of the other ones will probably intimidate some less chatty coders for sure",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"still wondering how the turks aren't snowballing into europe nor asia, but I'm not complaining :p ",surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the edit feature here is pretty nice, lack of sleep makes me a bad typer :P",joy,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, I always like to edit stuff xD",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum as a history buff that you are, you'll probably love the eventual Kingdom Wars AB mode",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,woot nice,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sounds nice though,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,been a while since I last played homm3; got a new monitor and it looks a-w-f-u-l because the screen won't resize and the game doesn't have an option to change screen size :/,anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,I'm not buying that,anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"ikr, lame; a lot of fans hate the price tag and greediness",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,nice :),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,the HD remake is nice I guess,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but not good enough,sadness,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it did make some units look less like there's a fog over them,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"was strange to see that some of the units were made from parts, heh",surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"But no real big change; animations still very similar and stuff. All of that, and you get to miss out the two expansions and the ease to mod the game",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"anyway, gameplay is really flawed to me, easy to exploit AI and such",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"even the non-symmetry of the combat field itself, one of the sides a big advantage for no real reason",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,well it's an old game,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yes, but some new games tend to be made without using the old stuff properly as a base, they skip most of golden stuff altogether and make some new crap that has its own issues",anger,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,never really noticed an advantage due to that assymmetry,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum haha, that was the stuff I was talking about regarding the article I should write; the left side and right side corners have different number of adjacent tiles, I think that on the left side, the units in corners are more protected against melee attackers, as less units can fit near them",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"so that campaign made me realize the big issue, one extra hexagon can make all the difference",joy,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"but exactly 1 hp? there's some randomness in Homm3, hits aren't always the same - how does that work? xD",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,is that inside /deploy ?  or is that folder generated dynamically?,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"The campaign was uber hardcore; it implied low level units with low amounts of damage, so 1-2 points or so",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek deploy yeah, sorry, typed path by hand",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's a bit annoying when others patch something and I don't understand the patch, because it means in case of something, I can't maintain it myself",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,ok can u help me out a bit with changes to plasma field? i left this one for last since it's a bit more confusing than the others,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,\The shield is no longer triggered when Dark Priest is active\ -> is this something that needs to be done or is it working like that already? (easier to ask than test),anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i'll test it then np, was just gonna ask about units and powers that could help so thx ",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,also is there any other similar ability that causes counter damage like the upgraded version of plasma field proposes?,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"and eventually animation wise, it might be a little more awkward, as he would try to move and also shield.... so that change was my latest one and I'm really happy with the idea",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"currently there's no other one I can think of, kinda avoided that stuff because it was problematic in a lot of cases",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"\it was problematic in a lot of cases\ yeah this could be harder to code in, i'll have to try it out",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,any idea where to find/acesss queue code?,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sry for asking small stuff like that but until i get a good grasp on the source files and abilities/units it's easier to ask than to spend 15 minutes searching :P,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i'll take a look thx,love,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,usually github is really useful for searching,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"anyway, no worries, I know my way around the code a bit",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sure it helps but if you already know the answer to a question it's easier than searching :),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yea saw that, let's see if I can use it! Is G.abilites and Game.abilities the same thing?",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"not sure, some of the class namings piss me off badly",anger,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah I'm wondering how i will get to the `queue` that is inside Game,fear,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"as i said the code seem quite well structured, a bit surprising actually",surprise,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,send kudos to the original rpogrammer for me :),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i think i got how to code the counter thing but i'm having a little trouble with the coding itself (specifically Ability#target doesn't seem to be working as expected). so if u gotta go don't worry about me :) i'll keep working and hopefully you'll find some news by the morning,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but i'm not sure i can use that in the way you've described,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah the method Creature#takedamage has a 'ignore retaliation' argument so it's clear that something has been done like this but idk if it's exactly what i need here,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"right, because way back, Abolishe's passive was doing damage all around when actually receiving damage, so 2 Abolished next to each other caused issues",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i think the only way i can make this work right now is if the counter is only done when the DP takes some damage, would that be ok for now?",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the main issue i'm having is that when an ability is used on a target it should set a field (Ability#target) but somehow this isn't being updated correctly.. probably because some abilities attack a hex and not a target, even though they are affecting a target",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yep, that's the desired effect",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,more desired at least,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but if this idea i have will work (hopefully it will) it means that it is only a solution for this ability (plasma field) and not to all counter-like abilities,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"which is not the best thing, but means it will probably work as desired",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it's ok; no other counter abilities atm anyway,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"alright cross you fingers then, if only for this ability i can probably just use the #activeunit field we were talking about a while ago",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, confirmed, haven't touched that Adaptation unit design wise recently though, it's still in old style",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"if I think about it, will also do damage to \organic\ attacks, which are considered \melee attacks with range\ in some way",fear,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good thing you're still here just talking to you made me think of another solution :D,love,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"a stretched limb can get the attacking unit damaged, while an arrow won't; but arrow at melee range would still cause the unit to be targeted by proximity",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the way i'm doing i don't think i can check if the attack was a melee/limb easily, maybe it's something to be improved later on",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,hard to say without knowing the code better,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, sometimes it's really useful for me as well to just have someone to bounce ideas with, even if he doesn't contribute too much :)",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but seemed too much work and a bit too early to get to know all the parameters required,sadness,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,oh nice just saw that melee is calculated exactly the way it's necessary for this to work :D,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,thought it was hard to figure it out... but it's good news,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i agree, first things first: making a fun game that can be played",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,and enjoyed,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it works :D,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good stuff! i was hoping to add a feature to help debugging but i guess it's too late to start that today :P,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,because today i had to change the value of hardcoded upgrades to 1 manually,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"figured; and even later on, there's no UI setting for 1",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,if somehow i pushed that into the source code by mistake it would be a huge problem,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there used to be lame settings with low time pools or just a few plasma point pools, not useful for real gameplay, but useful for testing indeed",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah exactly that but without a system for that if a programmer starts messing around with 'testing features' then it could somehow end up in the code if he is not careful about returning things to their original state,fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i really won't have time to do that tomorrow but maybe next week :) it's a simple thing but helpful but gotta figure out how to do it properly,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"well, all actions get logged atm and can be replayed, so that's helpful",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,alright i'd have to see how it's programmed then :) but rly if you think i'd be a good asset for the team i'd ask you to start working on that networking code asap.. we could use it for the undo and replay features as well,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,plus getting to play the game with you guys would be a total winner :D,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"that guy from London, he's my best buddy",love,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"and after a few matches, he tends to learn all the stuff and beat the crap out of me at my own game xD",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sounds like a nice guy :),love,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good thing there's a 2vs2 and could play along with him vs others,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I lost quite a few beers vs him, had to put a cap and try to earn back some of them",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,oh yeah absolutely! man i'm dying to play a match of this online hahah,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"interesting but online games are easy to cheat, we'd have to make sure cheating is very hard to do",fear,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah that is something easier to do when the online play is working.. so you can test against other people + having fun while playtesting :D,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, didn't like it as much as the original C&C games though",sadness,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"anyway, they're putting bountysource.com to really good use",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,u said the changes would take 2-3 hours but it was more like 6 haha good thing i had the whole day for that :),joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"well if you want my help i'd be glad to give it, had a lot of fun today plus i think the game can get really good",joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, i'm not complaining just commenting on it.. also if i had more experience with the codebase maybe it would have taken only 2-3h indeed",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's your choice, as I said.. sometimes many developers can be a problem as well",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i guess you're already getting a lot of work done with these tests :D that's a good thing too,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i wish i could do this kind of work for free as well but unfortunately it's not possible right now.. but it would be a dream come true to work full time on a project like this,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,kind of a small change in that patch but good to receive contributions like that,joy,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's not working code, just pseudo code",sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,maybe not even good pseudo code,sadness,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"code looks good, will do tests tomorrow, will have to merge first probably regardless",joy,joy
