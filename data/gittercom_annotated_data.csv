Cucumber,"Hi Team, I just recently upgraded our cucumber-jvm version ever since then I am getting following error ",fear
Cucumber,So github is trying to replace irc :P,fear
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy Thanks , seems like I was using older version of cucumber-core , updated the maven with specific version and things started working ",joy
Cucumber,@Sidkiyassine just call the methods directly!,surprise
Cucumber,"Hello guys, need a help.I want to call the run my featute file by calling the cucumber.cli.Main form a java class by passing the the parameters like tags ,format..I its possible.I don want to use cucumber options as I have to pass the tag name s as a variable ...",fear
Cucumber,"Hello guys,\nIs it possible to get  test coverage using jacoco for android tests?\ndefaultConfig {\n              testInstrumentationRunner \cucumber.api.android.CucumberInstrumentation\\n    }",fear
Cucumber,"hey everyone, can someone help me out with running a feature file with specific tags included and excluded?",fear
Cucumber,and the above doesnt seem to work :(,fear
Cucumber,or does it create a new object every time also?,fear
Cucumber,"I think, but it's been a while since I did ruby cucumbers, that objects created in ruby stepdefs files not inside of a Before aren't re-initialized every time",fear
Cucumber,is that assumption correct?,fear
Cucumber,"hey everyone, is it possible to run only a subset of examples in a table for scenario outline?",fear
Cucumber,is it possible to tag specific table entries instead?,fear
Cucumber,"ah, interesting. Ill play around with this :)",joy
Cucumber,"1) it doesn\u2019t seem to call the constructor, or even instanciate final fields, which is a bit of a pain",anger
Cucumber,2) there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to use transforms in conjunction with it (I don\u2019t really understand how transforms work on Cucumber JVM but that\u2019s what people told me) which would help give you more flexibility,fear
Cucumber,"Seems a bit weak to me. It\u2019s a shame we haven\u2019t had any PRs about this, but I guess a lot of our enterprisey users just don\u2019t consider doing that (or aren\u2019t allowed to while at work)",anger
Cucumber,"But, I do not know how to make coexist the two versions, one for 3 and another for 4 in the same trunk, without duplicate code.",sadness
Cucumber,Again - would need a ticket in order to prioritise this. If there is no ticket the problem doesn't exist.,anger
Cucumber,"its something ive been planning to do as well, let me know if you make any progress :)",love
Cucumber,"@nablik if you re-run tests and they pass, I assume you've changed something to make them pass. Wouldn't that invalidate the previous test results?",fear
Cucumber,@Simon-Kaz your tests are trying to tell you something. They are trying to tell you your design is too tightly coupled to this external service.,anger
Cucumber,What's the value of a test result if the tests fail intermittently and have to be run several times in order to pass?,anger
Cucumber,@Simon-Kaz have you considered adopting a ports and adapters design so you can test without depending on external services you don't control?,anger
Cucumber,@nablik so what exactly are you testing? That you can retrieve the data from the 3rd party service? That you\u2019re displaying it properly? Testing both of those in the same test is very inefficient. I\u2019d split that up in independent tests.,anger
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy : My question here is not how to test or not. I have tests that cover each module separately. This one is more end to end test, in integration level. However, my question is related to merging 2 cucumber report into one instead of overwriting it. ",fear
Cucumber,i found a discussion on this topic but i cant find any resolution to it https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cukes/alias$20jbehave/cukes/enPlH3xut2E/Z-KyVl18ytwJ,sadness
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy  yes, removing cucumber-java from the classpath fixes that issue. Thanks. ",joy
Cucumber,"Hi, I am trying to run my test, but I can only see that my first test is running, but my second step in the steps definitions is not being executed, plz help, thanks",fear
Cucumber,Has anyone had any joy using cucumber-jvm to  allow bdd of a  Netbeans Platform App? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?,fear
Cucumber,i have a query.. i have multiple feature files but all definations dump into single step defination file.,fear
Cucumber,now problem is that i want to make multiple step defination files.. but here i did not find any way to share variable between two step defs... ,fear
Cucumber,the work around would be i need to pass variables to each function call which i guess really bad approach,fear
Cucumber,is there any possiblity to simplefy this using DI??,fear
Cucumber,its a crappy situation really,anger
Cucumber,i have an external service that SOMETIMES is down (too often for my taste),sadness
Cucumber,i can only verify that during a test,sadness
Cucumber,"i need some interim solution for now though, was hoping for the 'skip test' option :)",sadness
Cucumber,"yeah, ive added tags and removed those tests from main suite. I really need them ran though :(",sadness
Cucumber,"the failures are intermittent, so it'd be a shame to have the tests removed just because the service is flaky",anger
Cucumber,let it fail so the business prioritizes fixing it? :),anger
Cucumber,lol its out of my reach sadnessly,sadness
Cucumber,@dkowis I like that advice!,love
Cucumber,"So when people come by and are like, Why are your tests failing? Because I need to insulate myself from crappy services",anger
Cucumber,and they don't care about failing tests?,surprise
Cucumber,all marked with 1 failure :D,sadness
Cucumber,"fortunately, given that its only one test, it should be relatively easy to fix?",joy
Cucumber,so i dont think i can mock that one and leave the rest,fear
Cucumber,Your tests are trying to tell you something. ,anger
Cucumber,They\u2019re whispering \u201cyour app is hard to test. make it easy to test\,anger
Cucumber,nailed it!,joy
Cucumber,"Solve the fundamental problem, stop looking for workarounds ;-)",joy
Cucumber,i need the server dev to work out the setup/architecture for mock server though,fear
Cucumber,no point working with flaky services,anger
Cucumber,"after all, they are not what im testing",sadness
Cucumber,how can I achieve this -- a little details would help ,fear
Cucumber,i checked prototype and singleton but they did not work,sadness
Cucumber,so how can we do that.. let me upload my sample code.,fear
Cucumber,is there a way to detect if a feature is finished?,fear
Cucumber,Why do you need to detect if a feature is \finished\?,anger
Cucumber,or why not use @AfterClass,anger
Cucumber,theres no @AfterClass in cucumber jvm,sadness
Cucumber,"Ah, because it hasn't been finished yet",sadness
Cucumber,"yep, sadnessly",sadness
Cucumber,i think i tried all the possible options already ;),sadness
Cucumber,"welp, pull requests accepted, heh",joy
Cucumber,zsolt fabok's suggestion is really good if you need to do something at the end of suite,joy
Cucumber,"but my suite takes 3 hours, so i need to do something at the end of feature instead :)",sadness
Cucumber,Might have to do the much uglier \And the server is stopped\ steps for now,anger
Cucumber,"less than ideal, and it bleeds things that shouldn't be in the feature, but it's where we're at right now",anger
Cucumber,"ill play around with it some more, i need to work out something anyway :)",joy
Cucumber,good luck,love
Cucumber,ill definitely try :),joy
Cucumber,Has anyone successfully run cucumber-jvm using testng running each user case in a separate thread?,fear
Cucumber,cucumber-jvm is not thread-safe,fear
Cucumber,dont think that'll work,fear
Cucumber,so for now if I want to use gherkin in java either I run my tests serialized or look for another option other than cucumber-jvm?,fear
Cucumber,some tests are inherently slow,sadness
Cucumber,and splitting the suite in different groups doesn't look like a good option,sadness
Cucumber,e2e tests can indicate a lack of trust in lower level tests,fear
Cucumber,or a lack of coverage in those lower level tests,fear
Cucumber,"There are no lower level tests I'm afraid, legacy code, hard to add unit testing there, also monolythical app so no API tests",sadness
Cucumber,"yeah, that's hard",sadness
Cucumber,just slow,sadness
Cucumber,sometimes you're not in position to add lower level tests ,sadness
Cucumber,my job as an automation engineer is to create e2e/ui tests,sadness
Cucumber,Yeah that's a sign of sickness in the organization,anger
Cucumber,They're going to have a bad time,fear
Cucumber,that's a silo,sadness
Cucumber,"sorry, man :(",sadness
Cucumber,"Advocate for the change, not that it may get you anywhere",sadness
Cucumber,I'm currently in a similar area right now,sadness
Cucumber,and it's unbelievably frustrating,anger
Cucumber,"Hi guys, is there a cucumber-jvm branch accepting the Pickle type Steps from ast?",fear
Cucumber,hi @demos74dx. As far as I know there isn't yet. Are you interested in helping out with it?,sadness
Cucumber,I think it needs a pretty big refactor to accomplish though,fear
Cucumber,you could do worse than use http://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby-core for reference,anger
Cucumber,took us about 18 months!,surprise
Cucumber,I'll take a look thanks,love
Cucumber,"So, I've been wondering though, or maybe I'm \cuking it wrong\",fear
Cucumber,@mattwynne Am I correct in assuming that everything in  core.cucumber.runtime.model is trash and replaced by ast?,fear
Cucumber,also what does ast stand for?,fear
Cucumber,"Hello,\nCan we run Scenarios or feature in parallel with only one runner class ?  ",fear
Cucumber,I'm having problems printing reports on Cucumber JVM ,fear
Cucumber,I'm trying to use  https://github.com/damianszczepanik/cucumber-reporting  the reports are generated but no data is printed on them it shows 0 results,sadness
Cucumber,did this happen to anyone?,fear
Cucumber,i get it whenever the build fails,fear
Cucumber,"the reports are generated and I have tests that had failed and pass but I get non of this in the reports, the json file is generated and it has the pertinent data, the reports are just not showing it",sadness
Cucumber,"and i had to specify the path to the file, otherwise the reports would return blank because i had other json files in there",sadness
Cucumber,"I'm using maven by the way, and it is using that file because if I rename it brakes",sadness
Cucumber,yes I am!,surprise
Cucumber,"from what I can see is not injecting the data into the html, but that's strange because I can't even generate the report without the  JSON file with the data that it needs to populate the actual report, I'm so confused ",fear
Cucumber,"It\u2019s a fairly big task to refactor Cucumber-JVM to use Gherkin3 - @brasmusson did it for Cucumber-Ruby. I have a branch on Cucumber-JVM that started the work, but there is still lots to do",fear
Cucumber,im interested ,joy
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz I'll get one to you tomorrow, nothing is checked in atm and the code is a cluster fuck (pardon my french)",anger
Cucumber,I'm also referring to the ruby implementation wherever possible to mirror some of that.  Not so great at ruby so it's more of a guideline than anything for me.,sadness
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz I'm also fairly new to Git and contributing to OpenSource, been doing my own thing on Subversion for far far too long.",fear
Cucumber,"So I'm still working out the kinks there, like I \think\ I made my own branch on my fork, but it's not showing up on git for w/e reason.  I'll google all that stuff and get it up after I can clear my mental cache from this bit of refactoring I'm working on.",sadness
Cucumber,im an automation specialist (whatever that means haha) for appium and selenium,joy
Cucumber,appium is pretty much selenium so its refreshing ;),joy
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz but I want cucumber-jvm to be a plugin when it launches, so I kinda need this working first.",fear
Cucumber,"nice, I've done something similar with spring, but only really done android via selendroid so far.",joy
Cucumber,appium's great,joy
Cucumber,lots of potential,joy
Cucumber,works well with cucumber-jvm too :),joy
Cucumber,appium is an amazing tool for that,joy
Cucumber,oh that's nice,joy
Cucumber,but it didn't capture the time argument,fear
Cucumber,im still kicking myself for not going,sadness
Cucumber,should've shelled the cash out of my savings,sadness
Cucumber,"I was a bit off because I couldn't see what I was doing on my own screen, only the projector...flying blind",sadness
Cucumber,I'll  give it a try thank you so much! ,love
Cucumber,"@demos74dx thank you for the offer, but I would probably prefer to continue work on my own branch",love
Cucumber,@demos74dx What would users be able to do if Cucumber was a `@Rule` and not a `@RunWith`?,fear
Cucumber,"So their could maintain their own @RunWith configurations, and then simply add the @Rule to the Test Class meant to be run, this is where things get a little weird and (maybe) impossible for cucumber-jvm to do it",fear
Cucumber,"but as you can see, these rules require statement and description to be already implemented at some point",fear
Cucumber,not sure if there's a way to do so within the rule format,fear
Cucumber,"So basically, if Cucumber used rules, it would interfer less with other junit extensions?",fear
Cucumber,or coexist more easily?,fear
Cucumber,"granted you could still provide ways for people to integrate with spring easier, but now things much more decoupled and therefor easier to maintain",joy
Cucumber,"However, there is a whole hierarchy of features/scenarios/steps to run, and it doesn\u2019t look like a `Statement` can have children...",fear
Cucumber,you almost have to forget everything you know about modifying the runner and try to work with the (imaginary) runner already in place.,sadness
Cucumber,Which again means that IDEs wouldn\u2019t be able to report results nicely,sadness
Cucumber,"yeah, I'm not 100% sure it's cracked up to work with cucumber-jvm, because it's such a strange usecase for JUnit",fear
Cucumber,That would be excellent. Thanks!,love
Cucumber,or I solve that...who knows :worried: ,fear
Cucumber,"I almost might have to do that first actually, I am getting paid by somebody to produce results, so I kinda need to get a solution out the door(even if temporary) sometime in the next few days.",fear
Cucumber,"I'll get back to work, so close to running pickles :)",joy
Cucumber,does anybody know which version my IDE should be at for working on this?,fear
Cucumber,"Is anybody familiar with the direction the Keyword annotations are going in?  @Given, @When, @Then, etc?",fear
Cucumber,Does someone know how to integrate spoon and cucumber ?,fear
Cucumber,"Hi ways, any of you know how to use cucumber in a playframework project (scala)",fear
Cucumber,"Solved, thanks anyway",love
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy hey, I got sidelined from cucumber for a few days, back on it now.  I noticed these step def annotations were removed in master and I was wondering how they would get implemented, in the mean-time for my code I just made a @StepDef annotation that replaces all of them.  ",fear
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy  I'm not seeing any advantage to TreeMap over HashMap in RuntimeGlue.  TreeMap would be useful if ordering was necessary but I don't see any need for ordering here.  TreeMap access is O(log n) and HashMap access is O(1), we could see about a 10x increase in speed while accessing StepDefinitions if we switched.",anger
Cucumber,Yeah maybe. Sounds like bikeshedding to me ;-),anger
Cucumber,Is there any way to make intellij show colored output? like not monochrome?,fear
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy thanks.  I'm wondering if anyone has solved the problem of testing Angular apps from Java. \nBTW, love the Cucumber books",joy
Cucumber,Thanks!,love
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy some team members are suggesting using Cucumber-JS.  I think that would mean either having multiple test suites, or losing a fair amount of investment in Java",fear
Cucumber,"I don't expect all tests to be from the front end, but I would expect to be able to do this.  We can do this from DOM, but AngularJS doesn't really work that way.",sadness
Cucumber,"And while you can test at unit and component level, there's always a chance that they don't work together as expected",fear
Cucumber,It's perhaps more of a webdriver issue - just wondered if anyone else has had and solved a similar problem,fear
Cucumber,"@otoniel-isidoro-sofist - Thanks, yes I saw that.  It is in JavaScript rather than Java, but it might end up being what we need to use.  Trying to avoid either having multiple test suites, or losing a fair amount of investment in Java",fear
Cucumber,"Yes.  Thanks for your time today @aslakhellesoy.\nIf it's of any interest, the content here looks like it should be of help in my case https://dzone.com/articles/webdriver-and-angularjs",love
Cucumber,not glue but clue :),joy
Cucumber,@yevgenys sorry you\u2019d have to read the source code I\u2019m afraid,fear
Cucumber,"i see, ok thx ",love
Cucumber,Hi All I need help on this.,fear
Cucumber,"Hi All, I need help on how to organise my step definition in cucumber jvm framework.",fear
Cucumber,"I just gave the opportunity to cucumber-jvm again, but for me is really really important that the tests can execute in parallel. Most of the tests are e2e, wether they're loading a webdriver instance or attacking an API. Switching to jbehave, after researching a bit I think I'll find greener fields there.",sadness
Cucumber,Can any body help me how to create an executable jar out of cucumber-maven project,fear
Cucumber,i tried with 'maven-shade-plugin' but the created jar does not contain files under 'test' folder. ,sadness
Cucumber,Hi folks.  Does anyone know where I should put @Before(\@Firefox\) tags?  I can't find very much cohesive information on it.  Intention is to be able to control which webdriver to use for any given test run.\nIt's very possible that this would be better achieved using configuration or Dependency Injection.  Guidance much appreciated :),fear
Cucumber,"For example, The Cucumber Book for Java - which is great btw ;) suggests using\n@Before(\@admin\)\npublic void logInAsadnessmin() { ... }\nI'm not sure where should/could the code go, and when is it executed?",fear
Cucumber,not sure if you've gotten to the dep injection part,fear
Cucumber,"Thanks @Simon-Kaz.  Yes, it could be that I didn't realise that Dependency Injection was required.  I'll re-read",sadness
Cucumber,"hi, i am running into cucumber-spring-1.2.4 vs spring-boot-1.3.0 issues.  http://pastebin.com/KxVyNsRK (java.lang.ArrayStoreException: sun.reflect.annotation.TypeNotPresentExceptionProxy)",fear
Cucumber,i take it cucumber-jvm needs to catch up with the recent spring boot release? or am i running into a more obscure issue here?,fear
Cucumber,"hey guys,\nI am new in cucumber, but I need to use this(cucumber-jvm + appium) in my project. I installed all this stuff and don't know what to do. I general I understand , but in my project some programmer write some code and there a lot of classes. I confused. Can somebody explain this, or at least send me some helpful articles, I read a lot, but still stuck on this\nThank you very much!",fear
Cucumber,var code = \thank you!\;\n\n\n \n\n\n,love
Cucumber,```\nthank you!\n\n```\n,love
Cucumber,"As you\u2019ll see from my comment today, gradle swallows cucumber's STDOUT. Any idea how to make it not do that?",fear
Cucumber,(I don\u2019t know gradle),sadness
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy I still have questions about documentation\nFOR EXAMPLE, I have next code:\n```\n",fear
Cucumber,"@Simon-Kaz can you explain in two words about appium, cucumber and junit. In general I understand but still suck",sadness
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy thank you, man! very much. I understood",love
Cucumber,"have next problem, can someone help me?\n``` \nMessage: org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a new session.

Cucumber,"@mikolasw not Cucumber related, sorry",sadness
Cucumber,@aslakhellesoy thank you! I solve this problem,joy
Cucumber,"@aslakhellesoy also I have some problem, that I cannot open .feature file in my Android Studio",fear
Cucumber,"because when I click on the .feature file in Android Studio its opening a Notes App, and I cannot edit this",sadness
Cucumber,"I did it, thank you!",love
Cucumber,"Hi, guys.

Cucumber,Why it can't deal with already existing snapshot ?\n,fear
Cucumber,"sorry, I found the root cause.\nIs there any information when it could be fixed ?",fear
Cucumber,"thank you guys, but i already solved this",joy
Cucumber,and I have next question about sendKeys(). does this method have some limitation?,fear
Cucumber,solved,joy
Cucumber,"hi, I'm new to cucumber. I need to figure out what new features/enhancements introduced in the past releases. How can I find it? I'm looking for something similar to release notes. Thanks a lot in advance..",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I've noticed that it got quite popular, some nice projects are making really good use of it and I'm starting to like it as well.",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,Not sure why I or anyone else got added. Might want to consider asking first. ,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@seiyria Way to kill the vibe, you're free to leave if you want. I'm new to gitter and it suggested me people, probably that starred the project on github and might be interested in it. When I clicked add on someone it said that he was invited, so that sounds like something that has to be approved manually to me. Sorry for your inconvenience, thanks for your feedback.",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,FF is working online so it's definitely a problem with my browser when running localhost,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"oh gitter, why black text on black background for the text input T.T noob mistake, not setting background-color",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's because my system colors are a bit different, but nothing a minor hack didn't fix here :) i'm gonna report a bug though",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,cool; I've recently got into a tendency to use dark themes wherever possible,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i think so too, alright bug reported",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,can you guide me through how to upgrade an abolished?,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,@tukkek do you mean an ability? Abolished is a unit xD,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"in the issue you say only abolished have upgrades enabled, i just can't find where in the ui i can apply upgrades",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,#869 should be fixed asap perhaps in order to make testing easier ,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i see, great, let me take a look at the source code for the unit though (love how it shouts it's name when summoned btw :D)",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"hehe, that should help with getting people learning the unit names",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"well, it dies and leaves a consumable behind",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"not it's gone, not sure why it didn't leave at first",surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"no, chrome now.. it died but it is still there, both occupying the spaces and in the turn sequence",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,also how are you supposed to defeat a player if the plasma shield prevents any damage from being done? i'm taking some time to check out the creatures and powers now,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there's a bug currently and the plasma indicator doesn't gets revealed anymore under the dark priest after using some plasma, which makes things a bit more confusing",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"a lot of small bugs like that which need to be crushed in order to get things back on track, sigh",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i get what plasma is but i don't see it decreasing when i hit the enemy player.. is that the bug you mentioned?,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"so it's not really ideal for your Dark Priest to take hits, even if he gets shielded, as you lose summoning (materialization) potential and get closer to becoming vulnerable",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,that's not extremely important to be shown there,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"alright i gave the game a better look and i think it's got a ton of potential, and the code seems pretty decent as well - I would expect it to be a lot more disorganized to be honest, considering the hexagon shapes and all. it probably needs a lot of love to reach it's potential though, from bug squashing to computer ai, multiplayer and so on... i still have a lot to learn though so maybe i'm judging things too fast",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but i think im ready to try and code some of those upgrades now :),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good ^^,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"some of the Abolished's ability coding could get clean-up for sure, lots of nested if statements that aren't even required anymore, legacy logic",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,and that's usually the first file people tend to check out and get intimidated,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I'm constantly improving things, so if I keep at it, things should scale nicely for sure",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i saw a bit of that, but mostly a code organization issue, not a design problem.. anyway just my first impression of the code base... looks pretty decent to me even with that",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the guy who coded it is quite amazing, he's a really great artist and wants to pursue that path, so he'll be able to rejoin a bit later on when the focus is primarily on eye candy and animation",love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,you're both from same country :D,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@DreadKnight wonders how to get nickname autocompletion around, tab key not working hmm",fear

Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it looks pretty good as-is nowaday as well! sure it's not the most beautiful game in the world but it's really above average.. have u guys put any though on how ai and network play should be done in the future (sorry if I am afk focusing on hacking stuff),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,Which is a weird polygon of some sorts,sadness

Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,haha,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,seems you're better at this compared to me,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,too much shitposting on forums; learned how to get used to weird formatting,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum woot! so i need to start with @ to mention someone, like on twitter / fb",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"This smileys/emoticons roster is pretty weird, why does anyone need a \large blue circle\ in a conversation is beyond me",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"ahahahaha ikr, maybe it's useful for doing bullet lists or indicating status of something",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yea i guess if network play is ready the ai is not that important anyway! do you guys have any idea how to print a variable value for debugging pruporses? window.alert doesn't seem to work,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,more importantly when I run  `grunt` does it launch the version under the folder \development\?,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,@tukkek yes! grunt is all about the development atm,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"will try to make that more clear, I see how \stable\ vs development can be confusing, setting more stuff into place with time related to that",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,that would be awesome! i guess the design is already pretty good for a gamepad huh.. i wanted to add gamepad support for javelin but there is so many commands it's not really possible,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum yeah, constantly thinking of that, but current engine doesn't do 3d, which will be required xD so I'm guessing there will be a port eventually",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there is so much that can be done with this game, im getting pretty hyped here.. somebody hold me please xD",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,voice recognition: please let me summon creatures by shouting their names like a bad-ass xD,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"haha, a lot of people love mobas because they like clicking a lot, but those type of games don't scale uber well with a lot of tech tbh",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, hard to imagine a moba played with oculus for example.. unless you're just using it as an alternate screen that is attached to your face",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there was a moba made for tablets... and supposedly optimized and bs... but the guys in the trailer were tapping the tablet screens like fucking morons, you would imagine the cracking in no time",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I rage so much while playing on the PC, would probably just smash the tablet to pieces after a few dozen games tops",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,It is not healthy for your phone,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"maybe if someone made a 1st person view for mobas that would really put you in on the action but idk any that is like that... actually i saw one fps moba once but it wasnt that good, not even when compared to the classics",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"played on a neighbour chick's phone a 3vs3 one and I was tapping all around yet still winning, it was pretty easy stuff overall",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Smite is the closest to that, but honestly I can't see that working",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"It kills your capacity to view your surroundings, you can literally only see what is in front of you",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,the fact the distributor for smite in here is shitty and does all they can to leech money effortlessly does not help >.>,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"sanity check: units can never have negative hp, right? once they reach 0 they're gone?",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,most of the time you see your character's back mostly.... which is distracting,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I was constantly pissing off the initial developer  because of stuff like that, but otherwise things would be too alike",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"...I am playing a strategy game (EU4) right now, and the protestant reformation just started in Transylvania somehow. >.>",surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek yeah but I'm a crappy programmer, can't manage to code AB gameplay properly for now, or things would have been way further ahead",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I wanted to convert Sweden to protestant, but the goddamn protestantism spawned on the other end of Europe. #ThanksGame",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum haven't really played any of the civilization games myself :/ so many good old school games mentioned today that I haven't touched, only researched",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,(btw the abolished's drawing is so fabulours i can't handle it haha just look at it all flaming and stuff!),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek if it's not blocked; don't recall if it's coded, but we had some corrections to the formula to avoid ending up with NaN and have playtest ruined thanks to badly coded effects and scenarios",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,> (btw the abolished's drawing is so fabulours i can't handle it haha just look at it all flaming and stuff!)\n\n^ perfect depiction of me when I first saw the drawings,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"good, cause he's a Pride creature after all, @tukkek - might even be might favorite unit xD",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"hahaha i'm loving it. @DreadKnight  ok, this can be changed later as well, i was just wondering if i did my math wrong",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"And then it plays out with historical stuff and so on; empires powerful at the time like France and the turks tend to grow quickly while nations who fell like the byzantine empire dies early on; however, this game always finds a way to screw up history and have something stupid happen xD",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Like appearently having Martin Luther be born in romania, but hey... It's still fun :p ",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,aww hungary converted transylvania back into catholic xd,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the most obnoxious possible spawns for protestantism ever in this game - transylvania, hungary, sweden and normandy, but nothing in germany...",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,funny seeing different spellings of the same thing,surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"good, I'm confident you'll manage; he's most used after all, so it's important xD",love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it's almost done :),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,@DreadKnight you're in the wrong neighborhood https://i.gyazo.com/75a78c223ed7aecdacc64f5bfaed976a.png,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Oh, nice; the chat inlines image links",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,And doesn't crop it!,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"Yeah, nice upgrade compared to most IRC clients",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek should have picked a harder one, haha; some of the other ones will probably intimidate some less chatty coders for sure",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"still wondering how the turks aren't snowballing into europe nor asia, but I'm not complaining :p ",surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the edit feature here is pretty nice, lack of sleep makes me a bad typer :P",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, I always like to edit stuff xD",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum as a history buff that you are, you'll probably love the eventual Kingdom Wars AB mode",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,woot nice,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sounds nice though,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,been a while since I last played homm3; got a new monitor and it looks a-w-f-u-l because the screen won't resize and the game doesn't have an option to change screen size :/,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,I'm not buying that,anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"ikr, lame; a lot of fans hate the price tag and greediness",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,nice :),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,the HD remake is nice I guess,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but not good enough,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it did make some units look less like there's a fog over them,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"was strange to see that some of the units were made from parts, heh",surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"But no real big change; animations still very similar and stuff. All of that, and you get to miss out the two expansions and the ease to mod the game",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"anyway, gameplay is really flawed to me, easy to exploit AI and such",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"even the non-symmetry of the combat field itself, one of the sides a big advantage for no real reason",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,well it's an old game,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yes, but some new games tend to be made without using the old stuff properly as a base, they skip most of golden stuff altogether and make some new crap that has its own issues",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,never really noticed an advantage due to that assymmetry,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@Zephyrum haha, that was the stuff I was talking about regarding the article I should write; the left side and right side corners have different number of adjacent tiles, I think that on the left side, the units in corners are more protected against melee attackers, as less units can fit near them",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"so that campaign made me realize the big issue, one extra hexagon can make all the difference",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"but exactly 1 hp? there's some randomness in Homm3, hits aren't always the same - how does that work? xD",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,is that inside /deploy ?  or is that folder generated dynamically?,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"The campaign was uber hardcore; it implied low level units with low amounts of damage, so 1-2 points or so",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"@tukkek deploy yeah, sorry, typed path by hand",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's a bit annoying when others patch something and I don't understand the patch, because it means in case of something, I can't maintain it myself",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,ok can u help me out a bit with changes to plasma field? i left this one for last since it's a bit more confusing than the others,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,\The shield is no longer triggered when Dark Priest is active\ -> is this something that needs to be done or is it working like that already? (easier to ask than test),anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i'll test it then np, was just gonna ask about units and powers that could help so thx ",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,also is there any other similar ability that causes counter damage like the upgraded version of plasma field proposes?,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"and eventually animation wise, it might be a little more awkward, as he would try to move and also shield.... so that change was my latest one and I'm really happy with the idea",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"currently there's no other one I can think of, kinda avoided that stuff because it was problematic in a lot of cases",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"\it was problematic in a lot of cases\ yeah this could be harder to code in, i'll have to try it out",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,any idea where to find/acesss queue code?,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sry for asking small stuff like that but until i get a good grasp on the source files and abilities/units it's easier to ask than to spend 15 minutes searching :P,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i'll take a look thx,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,usually github is really useful for searching,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"anyway, no worries, I know my way around the code a bit",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sure it helps but if you already know the answer to a question it's easier than searching :),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yea saw that, let's see if I can use it! Is G.abilites and Game.abilities the same thing?",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"not sure, some of the class namings piss me off badly",anger
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah I'm wondering how i will get to the `queue` that is inside Game,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"as i said the code seem quite well structured, a bit surprising actually",surprise
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,send kudos to the original rpogrammer for me :),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i think i got how to code the counter thing but i'm having a little trouble with the coding itself (specifically Ability#target doesn't seem to be working as expected). so if u gotta go don't worry about me :) i'll keep working and hopefully you'll find some news by the morning,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but i'm not sure i can use that in the way you've described,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah the method Creature#takedamage has a 'ignore retaliation' argument so it's clear that something has been done like this but idk if it's exactly what i need here,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"right, because way back, Abolishe's passive was doing damage all around when actually receiving damage, so 2 Abolished next to each other caused issues",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i think the only way i can make this work right now is if the counter is only done when the DP takes some damage, would that be ok for now?",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the main issue i'm having is that when an ability is used on a target it should set a field (Ability#target) but somehow this isn't being updated correctly.. probably because some abilities attack a hex and not a target, even though they are affecting a target",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yep, that's the desired effect",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,more desired at least,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but if this idea i have will work (hopefully it will) it means that it is only a solution for this ability (plasma field) and not to all counter-like abilities,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"which is not the best thing, but means it will probably work as desired",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it's ok; no other counter abilities atm anyway,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"alright cross you fingers then, if only for this ability i can probably just use the #activeunit field we were talking about a while ago",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, confirmed, haven't touched that Adaptation unit design wise recently though, it's still in old style",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"if I think about it, will also do damage to \organic\ attacks, which are considered \melee attacks with range\ in some way",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good thing you're still here just talking to you made me think of another solution :D,love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"a stretched limb can get the attacking unit damaged, while an arrow won't; but arrow at melee range would still cause the unit to be targeted by proximity",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"the way i'm doing i don't think i can check if the attack was a melee/limb easily, maybe it's something to be improved later on",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,hard to say without knowing the code better,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, sometimes it's really useful for me as well to just have someone to bounce ideas with, even if he doesn't contribute too much :)",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,but seemed too much work and a bit too early to get to know all the parameters required,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,oh nice just saw that melee is calculated exactly the way it's necessary for this to work :D,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,thought it was hard to figure it out... but it's good news,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"i agree, first things first: making a fun game that can be played",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,and enjoyed,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,it works :D,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good stuff! i was hoping to add a feature to help debugging but i guess it's too late to start that today :P,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,because today i had to change the value of hardcoded upgrades to 1 manually,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"figured; and even later on, there's no UI setting for 1",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,if somehow i pushed that into the source code by mistake it would be a huge problem,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"there used to be lame settings with low time pools or just a few plasma point pools, not useful for real gameplay, but useful for testing indeed",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah exactly that but without a system for that if a programmer starts messing around with 'testing features' then it could somehow end up in the code if he is not careful about returning things to their original state,fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i really won't have time to do that tomorrow but maybe next week :) it's a simple thing but helpful but gotta figure out how to do it properly,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"well, all actions get logged atm and can be replayed, so that's helpful",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,alright i'd have to see how it's programmed then :) but rly if you think i'd be a good asset for the team i'd ask you to start working on that networking code asap.. we could use it for the undo and replay features as well,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,plus getting to play the game with you guys would be a total winner :D,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"that guy from London, he's my best buddy",love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"and after a few matches, he tends to learn all the stuff and beat the crap out of me at my own game xD",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,sounds like a nice guy :),love
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,good thing there's a 2vs2 and could play along with him vs others,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"I lost quite a few beers vs him, had to put a cap and try to earn back some of them",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,oh yeah absolutely! man i'm dying to play a match of this online hahah,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"interesting but online games are easy to cheat, we'd have to make sure cheating is very hard to do",fear
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,yeah that is something easier to do when the online play is working.. so you can test against other people + having fun while playtesting :D,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, didn't like it as much as the original C&C games though",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"anyway, they're putting bountysource.com to really good use",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,u said the changes would take 2-3 hours but it was more like 6 haha good thing i had the whole day for that :),joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"well if you want my help i'd be glad to give it, had a lot of fun today plus i think the game can get really good",joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"yeah, i'm not complaining just commenting on it.. also if i had more experience with the codebase maybe it would have taken only 2-3h indeed",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's your choice, as I said.. sometimes many developers can be a problem as well",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i guess you're already getting a lot of work done with these tests :D that's a good thing too,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,i wish i could do this kind of work for free as well but unfortunately it's not possible right now.. but it would be a dream come true to work full time on a project like this,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,kind of a small change in that patch but good to receive contributions like that,joy
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"it's not working code, just pseudo code",sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,maybe not even good pseudo code,sadness
Freezing Moon - Ancient Beast,"code looks good, will do tests tomorrow, will have to merge first probably regardless",joy
ImageJ,"Well I'm a fool, I pushed the button",sadness
ImageJ,"Ha ha, welcome Lee. :-)",love
ImageJ,"And: happy Super \u03c0 day. It already passed here... (not the entire day, but 9:26:53 am)",joy
ImageJ,welcome!,love
ImageJ,thanks hinerm for the help on github,love
ImageJ,"sure @dietzc , hope it's helpful :bug: ",joy
ImageJ,@rishabhsethi Not yet as an end user application. But much groundwork was done with the ImageJ2 project to facilitate a future Android-based version.,sadness
ImageJ,@ctrueden thanks for replying. Actually what I want to do is subtract background from an image and filter noise and then use threshold algorithm to detect areas of interest in the image. I dont want it to be a client side application. Just need to perform these tasks on an image. Is this possible? Could you please guide me on how to proceed? Thanks.,fear
ImageJ,"Sorry. I didn't understand that correctly. I want to create an android app which takes in an image and perform those operations on that image. So, I want to use imageJ's algorithms (by using imageJ's api) in some way in the app to analyse the image. I thought that by end user you meant that imageJ doesn't have an app on android similar to other desktop environments. If that is not possible, is there any way I can do it. Thanks a lot for answering.",fear
ImageJ,"That said, if you are looking for a \quick\ solution, ImageJ will not fit the bill\u2014substantial work is likely required.",sadness
ImageJ,"If you are looking to call _ImageJ1_ plugins, then it will be nigh-impossible, because ImageJ1 is very tightly coupled to AWT, which is not available on Android.",sadness
ImageJ,OK thanks a lot. Will have to look for something else then :worried: ,fear
ImageJ,"All right, back to Dragon Age for me! Woo!",joy
ImageJ,hi all! I'm back,joy
ImageJ,Welcome back!,love
ImageJ,"@dscho Sure, no problem.",joy
ImageJ,@dscho I noticed that PAvel has a GitHub account now! And an org. That is great!,joy
ImageJ,"The good GitHub people have this program where scientific labs an apply for a free silver plan, and we did, and got accepted.",joy
ImageJ,"Sure, if you like! I am fine either way.",joy
ImageJ,That's very cool about the silver plan for academia.,joy
ImageJ,They're really good people.,love
ImageJ,Major progress on the ImageJ OPS built-ins branch last night!,joy
ImageJ,Now it's just a matter of adding in the built-in methods one by one. Alison is going to do it starting Tuesday. :-),joy
ImageJ,@ctrueden great. great! great! ,joy
ImageJ,"Happy birthday, @ctrueden!",love
ImageJ,Quick question because i can't find the answer there (http://imagej.net/Writing_ImageJ2_plugins). Do I put the class file for an imagej2 plugin into the Fiji/plugins folder like  for a imagej1 plugin?,fear
ImageJ,Why not make life easy and Just Use Eclipse/Maven?,anger
ImageJ,"From the perspective of assembling artifacts, it doesn't look like IntelliJ's integration with Maven is very good.",sadness
ImageJ,Looked easy and correct.,joy
ImageJ,@dscho Aha! View > Tool Windows > Maven Projects. And lots of goodies are there!,joy
ImageJ,"I know I should resist replying to that. But I really need to let you know that every single time you make a dick comment like that, it is very hurtful. The emoticon does not make it any less. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. Nowhere did I say the tool was bad. I used language \it doesn't look like\ to imply that that was my impression after 5-10 minutes of searching.",anger
ImageJ,"Look, you made it sound as if IntelliJ is a sucky tool.",anger
ImageJ,And that was wrong.,sadness
ImageJ,"You transformed a positive conversation about how to accomplish things in IntelliJ, into total bullshit. Instantly. Good job.",anger
ImageJ,"Which does not work for me, because it does not use the javac of the specified java8 SDK",sadness
ImageJ,That's why i could not work with the script editor,sadness
ImageJ,"I tried this first, but did not work, so i created the issue mentioned above",sadness
ImageJ,"Yeah, requiring Java 8 was a particularly poor choice from a collaboration/cooperation point of view.",sadness
ImageJ,No javac.jar found (looked in /Users/janosch/Applications/Fiji.app/jars)!,fear
ImageJ,BTW I am not worrying. That design choice is not really affecting me at all.,joy
ImageJ,"And I do not use that software myself, so there you go. All groovy.",joy
ImageJ,"yep, the folder is still there, with a fine looking maven project",joy
ImageJ,"But looks like, that the generated pom is missing stuff like a <ModelVersion>",sadness
ImageJ,"@dietzc Sorry I missed you in #imagejdev yesterday. I was home sick, and by then I had passed out.",sadness
ImageJ,you feel better?,love
ImageJ,Much. I think I had food poisoning.,sadness
ImageJ,damn. i hate food poisonings...,anger
ImageJ,hi @ctrueden and @hinerm  I have a question concerning SciJava (and you are not in the Scijava Channel ;-)).  If I call getPlugin(SomeSciJavaPlugin.class) should I get the first match which is of type SomeSciJavaPlugin or just exactly this plugin?,fear
ImageJ,amazing. thank you,joy
ImageJ,I was thinking we needed Data and Views for model/view separation. But we don't.,joy
ImageJ,and have a nice flight!,love
ImageJ,"It is highly unfortunate that the ImgLib2 Views class is all static methods. We should probably create a ViewService in imagej-common with all the same methods. That way, the behavior becomes extensible. And then recommend that people never use the static Views.",sadness
ImageJ,"It seems it's a critical issue. Might be enough to add `if (srcClass == null) return false;` to `AbstractConverter#canConvert(ConversionRequest)` and `if (src == null) return false;` to `AbstractConverter#canConvert(Class, Class)`. Though the `NullConverter` might then need to override more `canConvert` methods too...",fear
ImageJ,@ctrueden whoops.. didn't see this,sadness
ImageJ,@hinerm Thanks for the bug-fix. I just pushed a different one that is slightly more thorough to the can-convert-nulls branch.,joy
ImageJ,Thanks @hinerm.,love
ImageJ,"It is exciting to think that JavaFX may be able to give us all worlds: standalone (i.e. external JRE), self-contained (i.e., internal JRE), embedded (i.e., applet) and JWS (i.e. launch from web).",joy
ImageJ,Less exciting that Chrome is dropping support for applets and JWS completely soon. :-(,sadness
ImageJ,looking forward to having you back in the office on Monday,love
ImageJ,it is sad to be here alone :'(,sadness
ImageJ,"Yeah, will be happy to be back!",love
ImageJ,So your notes about importClass and importPackage are no longer valid. __Except:__ JavaScript is not discovered properly when launching with Java 8 due to a bug in the ImageJ Launcher.,sadness
ImageJ,"@ctrueden Thanks for the update. I was adding the bit to the wiki so that I don't forget what I found out. Glad to hear that things develop, I will test with the new launcher.",joy
ImageJ,"Everyone FYI: a horrible Updater bug hit ImageJ today, causing the \jars/imagej-2.0.0-rc-30.jar\ file to disappear from the Fiji continuous release. I repaired the update site, and am hoping the  next release build ([currently in progress](http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/Stable-Fiji/)) does not suffer this problem anymore.",fear
ImageJ,The good news is that the Help > Update command of existing installations was basically unaffected.,joy
ImageJ,"Hey. A bit off topic, I tried to get started with imglib2, but found a few obstacles on the website. First on http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2 the link to ImgLib2 javadoc seems dated. What worked for me is http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/ImgLib2/job/ImgLib2-javadoc/javadoc/ maybe this can be updated?",fear
ImageJ,"Then in Documentation -> Getting Started http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2_-_Getting_Started the code is also a bit dated. The first section mostly works, but some parts don't. First problem: in the untangled version of the \long line\ it refers to \ImgFactory\ but the corresponding import is missing.",sadness
ImageJ,I don't like mailing lists - so maybe my suggestion is a bit biased.,sadness
ImageJ,"@emmenlau As for the \documentation\ pages, those are unfortunately not tied to CI so they fall out of date. My personal preference would be to migrate the \documentation\ including \getting started\ into the ImgLib2 Tutorials section, and tie it in to https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-tutorials with the rest.",sadness
ImageJ,"But I personally do not have time to do that. As Johannes says, changes along those lines would greatly benefit the community!",sadness
ImageJ,"If only two people ever edit a wiki, that is a sign that not everybody wants to participate.",sadness
ImageJ,And as a bonus I'll not even bug you about \community\ and \participation\ anymore ;-),joy
ImageJ,Less work for me.,joy
ImageJ,"hm hard to answer. some PRs in Ops are pending because of the ThreadService issue in SciJava-Commons and the bug in ImgLib2-ROI. Anyway, I will let you know tomorrow if I think its super urgent, ok?",sadness
ImageJ,"ok a release would be great, especially if imagej-ops could directly base on the latest versions of scijava-common and imglib2-roi",joy
ImageJ,!!! great ;-),joy
ImageJ,I wonder what it feels like to cut releases on a day that isn't right before a vacation/holiday weekend,sadness
ImageJ,"@hinerm Uh, what? Is it even possible to cut releases on other days? :innocent: ",sadness
ImageJ,"Hi, I am a new fiji user trying to run a macro on images (.zvi) acquired on a fluo microscope. However, fiji does not take the files into account. ",sadness
ImageJ,Can anyone help? Tx,fear
ImageJ,Right now our handling of multi-component images in Micro-Manager is pretty unpleasant; they're split up into \virtual channels\ for display on the ImageJ side.,sadness
ImageJ,"Sorry, should have defined terms.",sadness
ImageJ,"I like that perspective. The current ImageJ2 design agrees with that definition of Channel, but broadens it a little more.",joy
ImageJ,The conflation of channel and component causes a million headaches for us when working with ImageJ rendering stuff.,anger
ImageJ,"(Which would be a ton of work, but ImageJ1's display code is just such a bear)",sadness
ImageJ,"So, a major thing the ImageJ2 team is struggling with is lack of bandwidth to develop the various IJ subsystems needed.",fear
ImageJ,"Because otherwise, the IJ2 display subsystem is going to languish for at least one more year.",fear
ImageJ,We're going to be severely bandwidth-constrained as well; we're just two people and the company we're starting kicks off October 1st.,sadness
ImageJ,"There are lots of advantages to that, too.",joy
ImageJ,I think I got him a little fired up and energized\u2014not sure if he took any of that back to you guys.,joy
ImageJ,We have no shortage of opportunities; we just have to figure out where to assign our effort.,joy
ImageJ,"The main thing I want to move away from, when it comes to RGB/RGBA images, is the dumb packed ints.",anger
ImageJ,"Ahh, gotcha.",joy
ImageJ,"Right now, ImgLib2's approach is a special type called \ARGBType\ which is better than how IJ1 does it, but still a special case in some circumstances.",fear
ImageJ,And @landinig has quite a few words to say to us about that... pointed out a few places where that falls down hard.,sadness
ImageJ,"Yeah, I don't pretend it's ideal.",sadness
ImageJ,MM2.0 is such a radical restructuring though that I had to take opportunities where possible to simplify.,sadness
ImageJ,"Or else we wouldn't have any releases, even alpha releases, for another month at least.",anger
ImageJ,"Completely understood, and I sympathize.",love
ImageJ,BTW 2.0 alpha is available. :),joy
ImageJ,Gratz!,joy
ImageJ,"Oooh, Java 8. That'll be nice.",joy
ImageJ,"Yes, ditching Java 6 is going to solve a lot of problems.",joy
ImageJ,"Okay, thanks for the info! And good luck with everything; sounds like you have a busy month ahead of you.",joy
ImageJ,"Yeah, it's sort of terrifying. Even more than usual. I have to write the 2nd draft of the ImageJ2 paper, and prep my ImageJ2 talk for the conference, and prep the ImageJ OPS workshop for the conference. And as you know, when preparing technical materials like that, a slew of bug-fixes and commits end up going hand in hand with it.",sadness
ImageJ,So I fear lots of user bug reports are going to fall by the wayside for a while... :worried: ,fear
ImageJ,And likewise to you: have fun with MM2.0. :+1:,joy

ImageJ,"@ChrisWeisiger BTW we had a crack at porting SPIMAcquisition (OpenSPIM's MM plugin) to 2.0. We were not successful, in spite of spending 1.5h on it (it was intended as a first assessment how backwards-compatible MM 2.0 will be, and it appears that it won't be backwards-compatible at all; a lot of interfaces/classes have moved locations, therefore it is impossible to write a plugin that works with both 1.4 and 2.0). Not meant as criticism, just letting you know that we faced troubles and decided to stay with 1.4 for the time being.",fear
ImageJ,Hello everybody! I am having some problems with the imagej codestyle/formatter/prefs for eclipse. It seems that imports are reordered (in DefaultOpService for example) and `..<T> implements` is formatted to `..<T>implements`. I am using Eclipse Mars (which may be the issue).,fear
ImageJ,"Alright, thanks! What about the `..<T>implements` thing, though?",joy
ImageJ,No I'm wrong.,sadness
ImageJ,@Squareys Sorry to hear that Mars has problems. But thanks for the heads up; I was _just_ about to switch after @hinerm said things were working well for him (but we didn't test code clean up...),sadness
ImageJ,"Alright, thank you for clarifying, and thanks for helping!",love
ImageJ,"@ctrueden Hi Curtis, maybe you can help me with this: I'm trying to run imagej from eclipse, but it does not load the script editor (it does not exist under File > New >... ) How do I need to configure eclipse to load it from my local imagej-ui-swing project?",fear
ImageJ,Is that good enough?,fear
ImageJ,"For the latter: unlikely before next year, since ditching Java 6 will have serious consequences.",fear
ImageJ,@ctrueden I cannot use ScriptEditorTestDrive for https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ui-swing/issues/52. It cannot reproduce the bug.,fear
ImageJ,@bnorthan absolutely!,joy
ImageJ,"@bnorthan Thanks, will definitely upgrade that before the end of the week, then.",joy
ImageJ,@hinerm Behold! https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/8166d835d66cc4735b177e7780aaadf73b32d2d9,joy
ImageJ,"@ctrueden Simply put, I sort all my SingletonPlugins in initialize, but their infos currently return null for some reason, they are already in the instance map though.",fear
ImageJ,"Ah, I see DefaultAppService does the plugin handling lazily.",sadness
ImageJ,"Because it takes time during `new Context()` to do all that stuff, which slows down the application startup.",sadness
ImageJ,So we do tons of lazy init stuff in many services.,sadness
ImageJ,"@ctrueden Okay, thanks!",love
ImageJ,"@ctrueden, @hinerm, when calling an op should python lists be automatically converted to java arrays??  \n\nthis does not seem to work...\n```\nphantom=ops.create().img([xSize, ySize)]\n```\n\nto get around it I have to use jarray\n```\n phantom=ops.create().img(array([xSize, ySize], 'l'))\n```\n\n",fear
ImageJ, that sounds familiar @bnorthan .. not sure if there's a good way around it,sadness
ImageJ,"I can't even get the `array` working personally, in the latest Fiji..",sadness
ImageJ,"Yes, the `jarray` thing is a known issue with Jython.",sadness
ImageJ,I don't think there is a way around it.,sadness
ImageJ,"So, that will be awesome for our workshop!",joy
ImageJ,@ctrueden no jython support: https://github.com/bobbylight/RSTALanguageSupport,sadness
ImageJ,Too bad Groovy is also considered broken right now.,anger
ImageJ,@hinerm the code segment above only works with imagej-ops 0.16. ,sadness
ImageJ,"Oh, it is `array`",surprise
ImageJ,so you don't have the context of the full stack trace to blacklist something,sadness
ImageJ,"@ctrueden, @hinerm  \n\ndoes the content assist work for groovy??\n\nspeaking of groovy the following code does not work because ArrayList is not converted.  I can work around it using the Dimensions interface, but it would be nice to be able to use the concise call in the workshop.  \n```\n// @OpService ops\n\nops.create().img([20,20])\n```",sadness
ImageJ,it doesn't work for groovy yet :(,sadness
ImageJ,I am 99% sure it won't work because I have never actually used them.. :D,sadness
ImageJ,haha and they don't build,joy
ImageJ,@hinerm thanks Mark.  I'll take a look at it and let you know. ,love
ImageJ,@hinerm when running mvn it seems to fail on the ConversionUtilsTest\n\n>ConversionUtilsTest.testPrimitiveArray:266->setFieldValue:531 \u00bb ClassCast [I c...,sadness
ImageJ,Did I mess up the include/import procedure?,fear
ImageJ,@NoamGit you are almost certainly missing the Maven dependencies of the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin,fear
ImageJ,"@dscho  Sorry for these very basic questions, but can I specify it as parent POM by simply adding \n'''\n<parent>\n\t\t<groupId>sc.fiji</groupId>\n\t\t<artifactId>pom-fiji</artifactId>\n\t\t<version>9.0.0</version>\n\t\t<relativePath />\n\t</parent>\n'''\nto the project pom.xml?",fear
ImageJ,@dscho It seems that Google Code shut its doors yesterday. Several jobs reference it:\n```\n$ grep code.google jobs/*/config.xml\njobs/Fiji-synchronizer/config.xml:    https://code.google.com/p/fiji-bi/=https://code.google.com/p/fiji-bi/ \\\njobs/ImageJA-synchronizer/config.xml:    https://code.google.com/p/fiji-bi.imageja/\njobs/MSysGit-Git-Git-Mirror/config.xml:# https://code.google.com/p/msysgit.4msysgit/</command>\njobs/MSysGit-Git-Mirror/config.xml:#    https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/</command>\njobs/ThunderStorm-Git-Mirror/config.xml:    https://code.google.com/p/thunder-storm/ \\\n```\nWould you agree that I should remove those repos from those jobs?,sadness
ImageJ,"A little bit surprising, given that they promised to turn things read-only.",surprise
ImageJ,"It's just that ImageJA-synchronizer tried to push to Google Code due to changes on the other side, which of course failed.",sadness
ImageJ,"Yep, MSysGit is lying on the beach, enjoying the sun.",joy
ImageJ,Thanks for the advice\u2014I will file an issue for it.,joy
ImageJ,The Git for Windows website is looking awesome now. :+1:,joy
ImageJ,Except that the version tag is missing.,sadness
ImageJ,"Tons of work to do, still.",sadness
ImageJ,"I was reading the governance model page, which is nice.",joy
ImageJ,"Hey, that's almost looking like a flat bell curve!",surprise
ImageJ,@ctrueden  sorry I missed this.   Would you be available to meet at 4:00 eastern/3:00 central??  Or later in the week if that doesn't work. ,sadness
ImageJ,thanks for the release @hinerm @ctrueden ,joy
ImageJ,@ctrueden sounds good,joy
ImageJ,@dietzc thanks a lot.  Those instructions were useful.  I have some more questions which I will post to the dev list. ,joy
ImageJ,actually I'm not sure if the imagej-dev list is the right place for KNIME related prolems,fear
ImageJ,Hah! Gotcha.,joy
ImageJ,I even did JavaDoc. Wow ;-),joy
ImageJ,I may convert some Java examples only to scripts. Still cogitating. The UsingOps example is still a pain in Java due to lack of sufficient type-safe method signatures.,anger
ImageJ,"Actually it doesn't completely work on the topic branch right now due to `add(Img, Img)` no longer matching as expected.",sadness
ImageJ,This works with the \Confocal Series\ sample image.  The only hiccup is I can't figure out how to set the axes on the new image....  ,sadness
ImageJ,"After mucking around with the ImageJ tutorials a bunch on a topic branch, I was reminded why I had them structured as separate JARs... and I'm not sure how to proceed.",fear
ImageJ,It's the two-edged sword of extensibility once again. Some of the tutorials add rather disruptive extensions to the context.,anger
ImageJ,And some of those could be Java sources\u2014that is fine. But that only works for single-file Java sources which are \runnable\ in some sense.,sadness
ImageJ,Some of the tutorials are not really runnable from Script Editor. E.g.: the new module preprocessor plugin.,sadness
ImageJ,@dietzc thanks for the suggestion but it didn't work.  ,sadness
ImageJ,Would really appreciate!,love
ImageJ,Because it can't be shared publicly?,sadness
ImageJ,"@gab1one: Oh yeah, cool.",joy
ImageJ,like this :D,joy
ImageJ,"If you think so, then great. You're the one who knows the requirements for the problem. :smile:",joy
ImageJ,It's nice that your data is so clean and nearly noise free.,joy
ImageJ,"yeah, but i still am missing the finishing step",sadness
ImageJ,effort appreciated! ,love
ImageJ,"if we can nail that down, that would be so cool",joy
ImageJ,i'm getting some bars when plotted :(,sadness
ImageJ,"followed by create selection, when i click on save coordinates the selection disappears i dont know if thats what is causing problem",fear
ImageJ,I have to run; I think you have what you need. Best of luck with your project.,joy
ImageJ,yes but this is not what i wanted,sadness
ImageJ,I think you choose the wrong plotter for this,sadness
ImageJ,what would be the right way in that case?,fear
ImageJ,Fellas my query still goes unresolved,sadness
ImageJ,how can i send u the data points,fear
ImageJ,cool,joy
ImageJ,"ok, the points are correct, but exel is definitely not the right tool to plot it. Generally not a good the best idea to plot pixel values with a scatter plot..",sadness
ImageJ,"glad that works but im afraid i wanted something else,..",fear
ImageJ,"i used [KNIME](https://www.knime.org/)  for that, its free, open-source and awesome, but I might be biased  :D  ",joy
ImageJ,It's not a show stopper.  The script still functions.  I just can't create a display when creating the new ImgPlus with meta data.,sadness
ImageJ,One thing I was wondering: why do you use `display.createDisplay` instead of `ui.show`?,surprise
ImageJ,"BTW, I still didn't have time to track down the bug above; will discuss with @hinerm tomorrow morning.",sadness
ImageJ,"OK, sounds good.",joy
ImageJ,Cool.,joy
ImageJ,"really, really strange",surprise
ImageJ,the problem is that you are copying all of the metadata about the original `ImgPlus` even when it's not applicable,anger
ImageJ,":worried: I was thinking `ImgPlus(Img, CalibratedSpace)` but since we can't cast in python that won't work..",fear
Jhipster,"Welcome everyone, I officially announce this chat room opened!",joy
Jhipster,thank you for the great piece of generator,love
Jhipster,"Nice ! I asked about the mailing list because I think more people could ask more questions, share some thoughts, help each other... Twitter is too restrictive, github issues too formal and I've seen people losing credibility on stackoverflow because of nothing. But I got your point, this might be helpful enough. Thanks",joy
Jhipster,Awesome,joy
Jhipster,"hey guys, does anybody have an idea to reduce the switches further in this [PR](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/1496)",fear

Jhipster,Thanks for the tip about the directory exclusions for IntelliJ Henri.  I've been using the \show grunt tasks\ in IntelliJ along with the Gradle window to execute bootRun and serve from the IDE.  So far so good...,joy
Jhipster,"Hello all, I love the idea of jhipster, and have played with it a bit, but I have some concerns about it and would like to hear your opinions of them:",fear
Jhipster,"First up, I don't like the monolithic nature of the thing generated in one big fat directory and would prefer seperate projects. I could split it up post generation, but then I couldn't use the workflow to add more tables/relationships/etc easily. So I thought maybe it'd be possible to have a few directories in a tree. Something like generator top level where the yeoman stuff is stored, and subdirs for db access, front end, split away from each other and able to be worked on independently and released independently with different life cycles.",anger
Jhipster,Obviously the monolithic style should be retained as default. However it'd be really nice if it supported a split out layout.,sadness
Jhipster,"OK, got the latest fired up here, metrics work java -jar target/*.war on my local amd64 Ubuntu box, but not on my server with the same war in i386",fear
Jhipster,"I recall being able to get it into a confused state where other menus also wouldn't work, but not the details, and my memory may be wrong.",sadness
Jhipster,Ha! Solved. Adblock plus was killing it. :-D Wish I'd realised that last time. Looks neat :-),joy
Jhipster,hey guys. just a question. how hard would be to pivot jhipster to a microservice generator with an optional UI ?,fear
Jhipster,Does anybody got a clue how to simply add a custom angular route quickly ? I tried to use angular-fullstack generator but it seams that JHispter is using the same structure but not the plugin.,fear
Jhipster,"I just give a try to angular-fullstack but you can not just add a route without creationg a full application and this is not the qucik, clean, easy solution i want :) Will try angular.",sadness
Jhipster,"yes, with angular too it is not  directly working. ",sadness
Jhipster,"Good to hear you're at least partially open to it, anyway :-)",joy
Jhipster,"in any case, i love what you've done, it gives me a single-handed chance at doing a full fledged web app for my project ",joy
Jhipster,we talk about different things I'm afraid,fear
Jhipster,"yes, understood",joy
Jhipster,"and it's nice to depend on the released artifact and solely develop and build the things that depend on that, above",joy
Jhipster,"I hate multi-project modules with Maven, but I'm not doing JHipster only for myself, that's why we have different options in the generator :-)",anger
Jhipster,"i hate them, too",anger
Jhipster,"exactly, and you could more easily say that a particular artifact was stable.",joy
Jhipster,"so it's a bit complicated to know what should be put in a lib, and what should be generated",fear
Jhipster,I like the ideea of having multiple jshipster apps talking to each other via REST. maybe also by some messaging system?,joy
Jhipster,not a big fan of maven modules especially created based on application layers,sadness
Jhipster,Hi guys I have some entities which work fine in dev mode but after the grunt compression some of them fail. Which is the best place to start to fix this.,fear
Jhipster,"I can see the rest resources request, the html file, which are all the same in the target folder but the table is not rendered. And clicking the create button just opens up the dialog with missing buttons.",fear
Jhipster,Thanks I'll try to debug this on JS level to see what is happening.,joy
Jhipster,"Can't say i was expecting that to be so in-your-face, sorry.",sadness
Jhipster,"I'll stick with jhipster 2.X, thanks :-) Cheers for the link, though.",joy
Jhipster,"Perfect! I was thinking the same thing, just getting through my dinner before commenting :-)",joy
Jhipster,@jdubois @fredcooke Spring Cloud Netflix - got my head spinning ,sadness
Jhipster,"@jdubois the netflix stack is awesome. We've used only some parts of it yet (hystrix, archeus) but ir really rocks! So jhipster build on spring boot netflix would be awesome!",joy
Jhipster,"Hello, I wonder why directory  bower_components/ isn't mentioned in .gitignore file so that i won't be versioned?",fear
Jhipster,"it's a shame that all of these front end parts aren't pulled in as dependencies too, are you guys aware of the webjars project? somewhat in contradiction of the hipster movement, but... :-)",anger
Jhipster,I'd be more OK with it if the raw materials were stored in ~/.something and just used during the build to assemble something working.,sadness
Jhipster,"Checking other people's artifacts into SCM is so 1995, and not very hipster at all.",sadness
Jhipster,@deepu105 not yet,sadness
Jhipster,"OK, but where does this textarea tag comes from?",fear
Jhipster,"My own fault, I changed an input  field into textarea.",sadness
Jhipster,"A more general question I have, if there are any plugin concepts available in jhipster. What we are looking  for is to disable/enable a set of features just by dropping some jars from the project structure, or coordinate different build targets in a way that different features are released and others are excluded per target. Resulting in different feature set over all layers, web (navigation, forms), service and data. Just disabling it by roles doesn't help since we have different bundles of the application and these need to be handled per customer. Any hints are welcome.",fear
Jhipster,"Thought of profile already, thanks. Simply said the feature I am looking for is how to merge two or many jhipster apps by configuration. At the moment we are just branching per customer, which works fine but requires some manual work. Otherwise we are quite happy with the stack. ",joy

Jhipster,:+1:  Impressive you can keep the nearly weekly release cycle!,joy
Jhipster,"@atomfrede it's very easy to release with NPM, I just have to do a \npm publish\ :-)",joy
Jhipster," Yup NPM rocks :) especially if u use a grunt/gulp plugin that does the major, minor auto bump and git commit, tag and npm update everything in one step is so neat, you should consider using those as well for your own workflows",joy

Jhipster,I can't test it as I don't have SQL Server,sadness
Jhipster,"yes it interests me, but I'm really not sure they will",fear
Jhipster,and anyway I'm on a Mac,sadness
Jhipster,I'm reading it! Thanks!,joy
Jhipster,glad to know no one will have to go through this suffering,joy
Jhipster,but it changes a lot of stuff in the templates,fear
Jhipster,I would need to make a new repo for the samples,sadness
Jhipster,"not sure if I'll do this, it's quite a lot of work, and it would be temporary as I won't be able to maintain everything",sadness
Jhipster,"Yes, I'll put this feature in BETA anyway, so hopefully it won't break too many things",fear
Jhipster,it's surprisingly easy in fact,surprise
Jhipster,"actually I'm gonna get drunk and will do that tomorrow, today was a long day haha",joy
Jhipster,"@jdubois please keep me updated on the feedback with the SQL Server tip, it's pretty sketchy, it does work but it's plain weird.",fear
Jhipster,"anyway saw the tips n' tricks section, good stuff.",joy
Jhipster,Tips and tricks look awesome,joy
Jhipster,"but documentation doesnt seem the correct place, coz documentation otherwise talks about using what is bundled in the generator and tips and tricks is about using external plugins and stuff rite",fear
Jhipster,"this is confusing to me. I can see why frontend would like to have it's own server stack, but to me the whole architecture seem to be a recipe for problems ",fear
Jhipster,I suspect this would create many problems,fear
Jhipster,I dont know if it will create problem but it would take more effort and is more complex,anger
Jhipster,"Hi!\nI'm trying to deploy the generated warfile but I get a WARNING: Unable to load class [my.package.ApplicationWebXml] to check against the @HandlesTypes annotation of one or more ServletContentInitializers. error , same for ApplicationWebXML and for LoggingAspect. I get the same errors for both the \basic\ and the .original warfile that was generated. Any tips to solve this?",fear
Jhipster,I got Exception in thread \main\ java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: my/package/Application : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0,fear
JSPM,Another question: github.jspm.io is unbelivably slow (20 seconds to load jquery.min.js). Is it known issue?,fear
JSPM,But I can't find anything about it in ES6 draft: https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html,sadness
JSPM,I'm mainly concerned with browser environment,fear
JSPM,"Because on server CJS is standard, there's no problem",joy
JSPM,We're not at a place yet to define these workflows unfortunately,sadness
JSPM,I think it will still be another 6 months or so,sadness
JSPM,we're still in teething,sadness
JSPM,but yeah it's not easy at the moment,fear
JSPM,I'm more concerned about existing plugins than ES6 transcompilation,fear
JSPM,We need somehow to allow authors to create ecosystem builds for their existing components. Not only the new that are written in ES6 format.,fear
JSPM,yes that's a good target,joy
JSPM,NPM allows only for one \attachment\ per version,sadness
JSPM,And if you publish something to NPM it stays there forever.,sadness
JSPM,but we have no standard output format unfortunately,sadness
JSPM,Maybe I don't understand something,fear
JSPM,"I don't understand why they standardized loading, but not defining.",anger
JSPM,No. How SytemJS is deviating from standard ES6 Loader :),fear
JSPM,all extensions are non-standard,sadness
JSPM,It's shame they didn't standardize System.register API,anger
JSPM,Now I need to persuade people to it,anger
JSPM,note that the browser loader itself is still not a confirmed spec,fear
JSPM,so things are still up in the air unfortunately,sadness
JSPM,yeah it's looking likely unfortunately,fear
JSPM,"So System.js won't be a standard interface anymore, right?",sadness
JSPM,"nothing, I'm little annoyed by this spec changes",anger
JSPM,yes desperately,anger
JSPM,"and we need it now, not in 3 years time",anger
JSPM,"But now, I don't know what to use anymore",fear
JSPM,UMD is a big fail,anger
JSPM,I don't know,sadness
JSPM,yes dynamic loading is screwed,anger
JSPM,Pure AMD solves this,joy
JSPM,For sure browserify allows for easy CJS -> AMD compilation,joy
JSPM,So it can be used for builds,joy
JSPM,difficulty is it is not just the format,fear
JSPM,but also the resolution process,fear
JSPM,how do I write code that uses jquery,fear
JSPM,"As for registry - yes, that's more serious problem",fear
JSPM,AMD for browsers is difficult to argue these days,sadness
JSPM,But that's loading stuff. Can't you use AMD-style defining and use System.js for circular dependencies support?,fear
JSPM,but it doesn't allow module portability,sadness
JSPM,which doesn't support that,sadness
JSPM,So AMD's \define\ supports circular dependencies :),joy
JSPM,It's AMD's \require\ that doesn't,sadness
JSPM,no AMD supports circular dependencies,joy
JSPM,but its different to ES6 and CommonJS circular dependencies,sadness
JSPM,Maybe some link? :(,fear
JSPM,all different!,fear
JSPM,What happens when you load AMD / CommonJS module with System.js?,fear
JSPM,What is the circular references behavior in each case?,fear
JSPM,"if I change p, the export value changes",fear
JSPM,but you can't match exact semantics,sadness
JSPM,"OK, so choice is simple. System.register :)",joy
JSPM,Would love to hear feedback on this - should all packages allow `require('pkg/submodule')`? Or could we restrict all packages to only expose main?,fear
JSPM,"thanks, that makes sense... so we should always support it because requiring users to make lots of separate packages for separate functionality becomes impractical at some level, when wanting to make highly modular libs",joy
JSPM,I'm porting existing RequireJS application and it turns out each `paths` entry actually means two things. E.g. `foo -> components/foo` actually means `foo -> components/foo.js` + `foo/* -> components/foo/*.js`,fear
JSPM,It makes a lot of sense to me,joy
JSPM,"yes, I guess I was still following the dream then of everything being a module name",sadness
JSPM,but users ended up preferring paths as it was what they expected,sadness
JSPM,whereas module names aren't intuitive,sadness
JSPM,which then becomes a bit confounding as to how to do the whole main / path thing,fear
JSPM,"But it this change allows you to implement require('foo.css'), I'm all for it :)",joy
JSPM,but the ES6 default will be to expect extensions,fear
JSPM,Is there a way to pass one extension through many plugins? Like middleware?,fear
JSPM,but I think it's ugly,anger
JSPM,But probably there's issue porting gulp to browser,sadness
JSPM,You can easily create new gulp pipeline from existing ones,joy
JSPM,"it could certainly be possible, but I'm not sure its something to encourage",fear
JSPM,With string you can't override existing plugin I guess,sadness
JSPM,"but yes, completely contrary to the webpack point of view",sadness
JSPM,Sites seems to support only .js mains,sadness
JSPM,great point!,joy
JSPM,but you could map bootstrap to bootstrap.css or bootstrap.js,surprise
JSPM,I'm not sure what the spec plan is currently for unconfigured sites,fear
JSPM,but the js is kind or irrelevant here,sadness
JSPM,not sure I follow,fear
JSPM,"NVM, I confused meaning of them.",fear
JSPM,I'm not sure what values of `deps` are supposed to mean,fear
JSPM,I'm not sure the benefit outweights the complexity,fear
JSPM,"yeah, good luck with that :D",joy
JSPM,I don't see what's wrong with the extra typeing though,anger
JSPM,we don't complain about it when doing\n<link href=\bootstrap/css/boostrap.css\>,sadness
JSPM,not sure I follow,fear
JSPM,I'm not sure,fear
JSPM,"It kinda makes sense, but it's hard to digest for me :)",sadness
JSPM,it was your suggestion!,surprise
JSPM,"Oh yes, I've found jspm on gitter, what an awesome feeling!",joy
JSPM,@trusktr that's awesome you're getting together an example that works in all environments,joy
JSPM,it would be really interesting to share the setup you're using to support all systems,joy
JSPM,"for the overrides, I'm not sure I understand why you need to override your own repo though?",fear
JSPM,point taken on making this process easier though,joy
JSPM,"i've just created a new project using jspm v0.10.3. i'm importing a file, but for some reason it's not transpiling ES6 to ES5 (i just get an error).",fear
JSPM,can't see anything about this in the release notes. am i missing something?,fear
JSPM,"i thought system.js loaded traceur, but i can't see it being loaded now.",fear
JSPM,"@guybedford I'd be glad to share! What do you mean by \the setup you're using to support all systems for the overrides\? As in the package.json? I don't need to override my own package, but overrides in general are useful for packages used alongside jspm-compliant packages, and for testing branches. It'd be a pain to have to add overrides into a registry for every branch you want to work with.",joy
JSPM,"@OliverJAsh @guybedford Yeah, it would be very cool if SystemJS would automatically load traceur and es6-module-loader. For now, you need to also include those in your html. For example: https://github.com/trusktr/portfolio/blob/master/app/views/pages/home.html.ejs",joy
JSPM,I'm desperately trying to get system.register module format working with system.js and I don't seem to be getting anywhere.,sadness
JSPM,"It works fine for requires within a library, but when I jspm install a dependency that is build with system.js, all my named imports from the library are undefined.",fear
JSPM,"When I dig into the jspm generated code, it looks like maybe jspm is confused and is writing out some commonjs stuff.",sadness
JSPM,"Ok, it looks like I got things working. It seems that the cli just doens't detect the register format. You *must* specify it in the jpm config format section.",joy
JSPM,@guybedford I didn't see the register format specified in the docs as an option but found it by looking through the code. It would be great to add this. I think another important thing to add is that you *must* specify it for register formatted modules or they won\u2019t install correctly.,sadness
JSPM,Thanks. I got it worked out by adding it to the jpsm section.,joy
JSPM,It\u2019s not exactly documented\u2026so hopefully Guy can make a few small additions there for future travellers.,sadness
JSPM,I have no idea.,fear
JSPM,I know. We're the ones needing more docs. xD,sadness
JSPM,"oops, haha. Thought I was at the command line.",joy
JSPM,this may be an update issue,fear
JSPM,The  latest release works. I figured it out and published one with the correct configuration.,joy
JSPM,"@EisenbergEffect great, so you didn't need to set the custom config anymore?",joy
JSPM,The documentation at that link doesn\u2019t mention the \u201cregister\u201d format as an option or that it is required for correct install of register module libraries.,surprise
JSPM,It shouldn't be required - auto-detection is supposed to work,surprise
JSPM,"So, I would just extend that a litle bit maybe with a few notes to that effect and everything would be all good :)",joy
JSPM,"the update may not have cleared the cache, so may have needed an `install -f` to work",fear
JSPM,"sounds like it could have been - minor upgrades of the endpoints auto-flush the cache, but this bug fix didn't include a cache bump (I probably should have included this)",sadness
JSPM,Because it was definitely generating the wrong code for the main module. It was detecting commonjs.,sadness
JSPM,Yep :smile: It was fixed about 5 hours ago.,joy
JSPM,ok right,joy
JSPM,thanks so much - yes I need to add a register then,love
JSPM,"ok that explains it then, thanks for clarifying",joy
JSPM,ok thanks will try that,joy
JSPM,"As for branches, I mean working with branches I don't have push access to and needing an override becomes more work. Because when I change the name=endpoint:source of a package, it will no longer get the override from jspm registry, so I gotta do it at the command line. Would be nice to store it locally in package.json. :D",sadness
JSPM,I'd say just go for the centralized docs on jspm.io. It'd be totally worth it.,joy
JSPM,"> the update may not have cleared the cache, so may have needed an install -f to work but yes, can be good to set format to be sure in these cases\n\n-f? What's that? Seems like something that should be a default and probably would've prevent lots of the issues I posted on github. xD",sadness
JSPM,"> but this bug fix didn't include a cache bump\n\nIdea: Maybe use the commit hash of jspm (or combination of hashes based also on the registry and plugins). So if I the commit hash of jspm, registry, or plugins change, then it'd cause a cache bump every update. Might be slightly slower, but better than having unexpected behaviors.",fear
JSPM,Great screencast. I'd put it on frontpage :),joy
JSPM,@guybedford We have a bunch of windows users that consistently have the issue \unknown command \u201cunzip\u201d\u201d when doing a jspm install. Any ideas?,fear
JSPM,"@guybedford We have windows users that, due to the unzip issue, very quickly end up exhausting their github rate limit. So, then they get that error. When they do `jspm endpoint config github` some are still getting the rate limit issue even after the credentials test succeeded.",fear
JSPM,@guybedford This user that gets the rate limit error from GitHub is also saying they get it on Mac as well\u2026even after they have configured it with their credentials. Any ideas?,fear
JSPM,@EisenbergEffect actually that may not be a fix,fear
JSPM,so I'm a little stuck here,sadness
JSPM,"when I set credentials on the asset request to the GitHub API, I get an S3 error response",sadness
JSPM,that is an authless api.github request,anger
JSPM,adding `auth` gives a 400 error,fear
JSPM,let\u2019s see what the twitter verse says real quick..I think i know some github people,fear
JSPM,but there will still be an eventual rate limit there too,sadness
JSPM,but this is a GitHub api bug,fear
JSPM,I just don't know how to report these things,fear
JSPM,Would be nice if they had a bug tracker.,sadness
JSPM,They're good at replying.,joy
JSPM,I got response on twitter.,joy
JSPM,ok it was my fault after all,sadness
JSPM,"haha, it's been a few more bugs than that",joy
JSPM,has certainly been interesting though,joy
JSPM,It always take two days for a round of communication.,sadness
JSPM,yeah the SF timezone isn't ideal from here,sadness
JSPM,"thanks, I'll check it out",joy
JSPM,@guybedford sorry for the long time to reply. I'm updating Node now. apparently I was on 0.10.34 (35) is current for Windows,sadness
JSPM,@guybedford looks like that fixed it. I updated nodejs and then followed the instructions here: https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#upgrading-on-windows to update my windows npm install to the 2.x versions ,joy
JSPM,Thanks for the help resolving my issue.,joy
JSPM,don't know if it was issued before but it seems like \jspm clean\ doesn't remove folders of packages installed via npm: or github:,fear
JSPM,jspm clean only removes packages not being used in the current project,sadness
JSPM,"ok , thx for the info",joy
JSPM,@guybedford Am I supposed to put `\registry\: \jspm\u201d` in package.json\u2019s jspm field if the package will be installed from `github:`?,fear
JSPM,@guybedford Or is it only meant for command line overrides? And should it be in the jspm-registry override? I think auto setting of this would alleviate confusion.,fear
JSPM,"Error getting package config for github:jspm/nodelibs-process. Unable to check repo package.json for release, status code 401. Any ideas?",fear
JSPM,@ricardomatias you've probably hit the github rate limits?,fear
JSPM,@trusktr I finally agree with you... :),joy
JSPM,thanks for pushing to make things easier,joy
JSPM,Error downloading github:jspm/nodelibs-tty. Bad response code 406. (With authentication back on.),fear
JSPM,@guybedford Thanks for getting the release out so fast!,joy
JSPM,Ping ping ping! I\u2019d like to get the jspm workflow for infamous published tonight. :D Just #380 needs a fix (or is it my fault)?,joy
JSPM,"@EisenbergEffect sure! Also aiming to look at the https://github.com/jspm/github/issues/17 issue sometime this month, just have a lot to prioritise right now.",sadness
JSPM,I understand\u2026trust me :),sadness
JSPM,Another github creds bug. Here\u2019s a screenshot from a user: http://www.screencast.com/t/YFUmnwum2aLC,sadness
JSPM,"As a side note\u2026if there\u2019s any way to not use the github api and instead use browser links, I think that would make things nicer. Another recommendation is to make the warning about github credentials a bit more obvious. I notice that people are missing that.",anger
JSPM,but that could get super annoying,anger
JSPM,yes exactly - there's an issue tracking that,fear
JSPM,"It would be nice not to have to worry about credentials. @guybedford Any conceivable way to do that? npm seems to work without a hitch, but github gives issues.",fear
JSPM,Does `npm` use api.github.com? I never see rate limit warnings from `npm`.,fear
JSPM,"release assets, not releases. how?",surprise
JSPM,I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s for. Why is it needed? I see releases here: https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/releases/tag/0.10.4,anger
JSPM,exactly,joy
JSPM,"What does it mean when jspm install spits back a 406 Bad Response ? Getting this from several github repos, just curious about it.",fear
JSPM,"So, the biggest issue we keep coming into contact with is Github api usage stuff.",sadness
JSPM,Rate limits happen a lot for us because Aurelia is broken into many repositories. So to bring it down requires a bunch of api calls.,sadness
JSPM,"If something fails, then people have to run it again\u2026and then they hit the rate limit.",sadness
JSPM,They often don\u2019t know or realize.,sadness
JSPM,"So, they get frustrated right away just trying to use our starter kit sample.",sadness
JSPM,You can put creds in\u2026but that\u2019s just another barrier to entry...,sadness
JSPM,I'm trying to install Leaflet which currently fails due to #289. I don't understand the workaround mentioned there though: \ The workaround is to add ignore: \debug\ to the package.json override\. All I could find about overrides is the registry which seems to host a bunch of package.json overrides. But how can I do that locally in my own projects package.json for Leaflet?,sadness
JSPM,"Yeah, leaflet is tricky. @guybedford ",sadness
JSPM,I don\u2019t like having to have a shell script though. The problem with leaflet is it doesn\u2019t use modules. It relies on `npm install` to build into a single global module. Jspm isn\u2019t handling that.,sadness
JSPM,@guybedford I\u2019ve updated https://github.com/jspm/registry/wiki/Configuring-Packages-for-jspm That will help new users so much.,joy
JSPM,@trusktr Thank you very much for the writeup. I had hoped it'd be a bit simpler than that too,joy
JSPM,@trusktr thanks for looking into the wiki updates,joy
JSPM,@trusktr the production workflows are missing yes,fear
JSPM,because it wasn't working as well as it should,sadness
JSPM,but time is a big constraint,sadness
JSPM,@guybedford Any chance of coming up with a github solution that doesn\u2019t require credentials? ,fear
JSPM,`jspm build-sfx` would be trickier because the html needs to be modified for it.,fear
JSPM,@guybedford I published the jspm workflow! https://npmjs.com/package/infamous,joy
JSPM,which is really low,sadness
JSPM,"yeah, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue",joy
JSPM,also there is strong caching,sadness
JSPM,I\u2019m mostly concerned with the \u201cgetting started\u201d story for jspm.,fear
JSPM,Besides the unzip issue (which I saw you solved..yay!) the creds issue is one people seem to hit.,joy
JSPM,Hopefully now that the unzip issue is fixed we will see less people hitting the timeout on windows.,joy
JSPM,I can see that being a problem with my community.,sadness
JSPM,which would slow down installs,fear
JSPM,Thanks yet again. I'll try your suggestion now,joy
